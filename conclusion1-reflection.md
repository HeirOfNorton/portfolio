Reflection on MLIS Career
-------------------------

As I have built and developed this portfolio, I cannot help but look back at my classes and see the common threads that were not apparent while I was taking them.
All aspect of Library and Information Science are connected, I am learning, and often in ways that are not obvious.
Here, then, are the thoughts I have on the courses I have taken.

##Fall 2011##

###LIBR 200: Information and Society, LIBR 202: Information Retrieval, LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management###

This was my first full introduction to LIS as a field of study and as a calling, and though I remain as enthusiastic as when I began, this is now tempered with the conviction and certainty that I can make difference in people's lives.
I was nearly overwhelmed by the sheer number of topics skimmed over in LIBR 200, knowing that I would be taking full courses on most of them at some point and trying to guess, from that first small introduction, which ones would be most fun or most important.
LIBR 204, on the other hand, to this day feels like the most familiar of all my classes, thanks to my experiences as a retail supervisor.
The lessons on client interactions have already served me well, while I was also able to bring my leadership training from work to bear on the course.
LIBR 202, though, I simply found fun.
I'm weird that way.
I like catalog systems and databases, and I look forward to working with these systems first-hand.

##Spring 2012##

###LIBR 210: Reference Services, LIBR 260A: Programming and Services for Children, LIBR 285: Research Methods in Library Science###

In this semester I confirmed that I am where I am supposed to be.
I began my MLIS career specifically because I enjoy helping customers but dislike retail, and LIBR 210 served as my introduction to the part of library service that most closely fulfills that desire.
I am still picking up new resources and places to find information, as well, and I think I will have to start a cheat sheet of possible resources by topic.
I enjoyed the challenges of LIBR 260A, and the collaboration in designing spaces and programs for children.
I am not entirely comfortable around children most of the time, so this was an interesting change of view.
I still find LIBR 285, and the concepts behind it, very intimidating.
To be perfectly honest, I hope that I never have to worry about the ethical and privacy dilemmas that come with social research, and that I can do my job without any such deep research

##Fall 2012##

###LIBR 228: Advanced Information and Reference Services, LIBR 248: Beginning Cataloging and Classification, LIBR 261A: Programming and Services for Young Adults###

I returned from Summer break refreshed to start anew with a semester that, in many ways, felt like a sequel to the previous one.
LIBR 228 turned out to be disappointing for me.
I was hoping for a more in-depth course like LIBR 210, but what I got felt like it was simply rehashing the same territory.
LIBR 248, though, was very fun (I've said that I like catalog systems and such, and here was a class full of little else).
I still need to show my niece the catalog record I made of her.
LIBR 261A, though, was the biggest surprise.
I was expecting something like 260A, something light and full of fun programming ideas.
I was not expecting a course so heavily promoting and advocating for YA rights.
It has made me a convert, though, so it must be doing something right.

##Spring 2013##

###LIBR 232: Issues in Public Libraries, LIBR 246: Information Technology Tools and Applications---Javascript, LIBR 266: Collection Management###

LIBR 232 was simply an unavoidable part of my education.
I still intend, if I can manage it, to join a public library in my career, and I needed to prepare.
This did give me the opportunity to consider some of the challenges I will certainly face in that situation.
Similarly, LIBR 266 felt like a "management" class, with a core of information that is important to know, but with the definite feeling that in my practical day to day experience I can probably ignore much what was covered.
LIBR 246, then, was easily the most disappointing class I have taken at SJSU.
I am already experienced with computers, but much less so with web building, and I was hoping that class would give me useful skills for that purpose.
Instead, the class was so basic that I learned hardly anything that would be useful on a real website.

##Summer 2013##

###LIBR 256: Archives and Manuscripts###

LIBR 256 completes the "fun" trifecta.
I have given serious thought since this class of pursuing a career in archives.
I am not sure if a single class is enough to prepare me for such a career, though, of if I would be expected to complete the MARA instead.
Either way, the sandstone cave under the U of M is huge.

##Fall 2013##

###LIBR 289: Advanced Topics---E-Portfolio###

And now a come to where I am.
I think it is safe to say that I _severely_ underestimated how much work this would take.
Even as I finish it, I cannot believe the amount of work that I put into it.
Still, as I said in the introduction of this portfolio, this work is the beginning of my career, and I am glad of how it has helped me bring all the lessons I have learned together.
