Competency A
------------

#Each graduate of the Master of Library and Information Science program is able to articulate the ethics, values, and foundational principles of library and information professionals and their role in the promotion of intellectual freedom.#

##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

As I have worked through my studies for the MLIS, I have been coming to grips with the many reasons for what information professionals do.
There are uncountable ethical dilemmas, questionable practices, and outright conflicts that face LIS professionals today, and just as many responses to them.
Throughout this journey, I have found a common theme to all of the values and ethics stated, even those that seem only loosely related at best, and have determined to find the core commonality between them in my own beliefs.
This core purpose of library and information science I have defined as such:

>   The core purpose of information professionals is to benefit the community and the people within it by connecting them with the information and intellectual resources they need and want.

This may sound simplistic, and even limited, but if taken to its full conclusion it has several implications that impact library and information service.
I intend for it to be applied without limits.
"To benefit the community and the people within it" means to benefit the _entire_ community, and _all_ of the people within it.
It would be against this purpose to limit the people to whom service is offered.
"Connecting them with information" means to actively help people to find what they need, and to never hinder their search or try to subvert it by dictating what I think they should or should not access.
It also means to connect people to any and all information, as much as possible, and without censorship.
"The information _they_ need and want" means that the users, the people that I serve, drive what information I find and offer.
It means never prejudging information based on my own biases, and to help find what is right for _them_, not for me.

This core is at the heart of how I interpret the history of LIS service and how it has changed and grown, though the focus has changed significantly over time.
Following the summary of LIS present by @Rubin_foundations10, I find that the earliest history of LIS service was focused on the information itself, gathering and preserving it.
Ancient archives and libraries were meant to collect and save information, connecting different sources together and protecting them from the ravages of the environment and time.
This, nonetheless, connects to the core purpose, as why else would information be preserved except so that it could be of use?
Without an audience to need the information, there is no point in keeping it.

Once this need to preserve had been established, more recent history is concerned with organizing information.
There is more information available in even a single archive or library than any one person could ever read or make use of.
Cataloging and classification, among other tools, are used so that the information available can be made known, and can be found by the people who need it.
It increases access, and allows the information to be used so that it can benefit the people who search for it.
Information that is preserved but not organized and accessible benefits only the elite who know about it already.

Finally, more recent times have shifted focus from the information itself to the people with whom it is connected.
The last century or so has been a mostly steady trend of ever increasing access to ever more people, though with a few bumps on the road.
Early public libraries were meant to improve people, admittedly with some bias as to which people, and promoting only the "best" information to do so.
As the question of civil rights was fought for in other aspects of life, so too was the fight for access to libraries, and the information they contain.
This includes several battles that continue to this day, both for access for everyone in the face of prejudice, and for access to all information in the face of censorship.
We are thus still working closer to the ideal of allowing and promoting access for all people to all relevant information, for the benefit of all communities.

Over the course of this long development, librarians and information professionals how continuously built and adapted their common values and ethics in order to maintain what we believe is right.
As I have grown my understanding of the values and ethics, and worked to develop my own personal standards within the larger LIS community, I have seen how they connect back to the core purpose as I see it.
The values and ethics of LIS professionals build upon that core, and refine it in detail, but never contradict it.

_Values_ can be defined as the beliefs in what is right and true that inform our actions and practices.
They are _why_ we do what we do.
There are a variety of codes of ethics that exist in the LIS world, most with many commonalities.
The values discussed here are taken from the values seen in common from @Rubin_foundations10 in his overview of Library and Information Science, and the core values adopted by the ALA [@ALA_values04].
There are several differences in these value systems, different parts of LIS service that they emphasize, but they share at their heart the core purpose and its implications.

Both are, of course, concerned with the protection of information itself, whether by Preservation in general or through the promotion of the Book, specifically, as a form of carrying information.
In support of this, as well, both are concerned with Reading or Education and Literacy, so that the information that has been preserved can be accessed by the people who find it.
Information must exist, and be in a state in which it can be accessed, in order to connect people with it.
This remains, though, merely a practical side that is in support of the main purpose of connecting people with information.
They also emphasize the quality and correctness of the information, with dedication to Truth and the search for Truth.

More telling are the values relating more to the people to whom we offer service and access.
First of all, the value systems demand Access for all, promoting Tolerance, Intellectual Freedom, and Diversity.
As implied by my core purpose statement, we must give access to _all_ people equally, no matter their backgrounds or beliefs.
Beyond that, both value systems are concerned with the improvement of the entire community, and the people within it.
Both list the Public Good as a main value, both preserving and building it, with additional focus on Justice and Social Responsibility.
Library service is not about preserving information just for its own sake, or even just for the benefit of a few, but rather for the improvement of everyone and the community as a whole.

If values are the _why_ of information service, then ethics are the _what_ and _how_.
They describe how we put our values into practice, and what deliberate choices and actions we take in order to uphold our values.
Values are a bit abstract, our deeply held beliefs, but ethics are concrete, how we show those beliefs.
Ethics, and the actions and decisions based on them, are also the area of librarianship where we are most likely to come into conflict with others, making it all the more important to understand ourselves and to be able to articulate ourselves to others.
Again, I have compared the code of ethics adopted by the ALA [@ALA_code08] with the discussion of ethics presented by @Rubin_foundations10.

Both emphasize a high level of service in the organization of information, and in our interactions with our users.
Information, after all, must be accessible if it is to be useful, and to be used.
In order to connect users to the information they require, we have to be welcoming, professional, and available.
Bad service is an obstacle to connecting users to information, and such obstacles must be avoided or removed.
They further advocate for resistance against any form of censorship.
It is diametrically opposed to the very core of LIS service to block, hide, or remove information that a user may wish to access.
Blocked information is wasted information, and limits the possibilities of what can be learned and done.

As with the statements of values, the codes of ethics go beyond the information itself to the people and community that benefits from that information.
They both see it as necessary to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our users, protecting the community from those who would use the information they seek against them.
If people do not feel safe in searching for information, then they will hesitate to begin their search in the first place, and will thus be unable to benefit from it.
They also advocate the protection of the rights of the authors and creators of information.
While at first glance this may seem to limit access to that information, far worse would be for the information to never be made available at all.
A balance must be struck in order to make the greatest amount of information available, and thus to allow for the greatest benefit to the community.

These ethical dilemmas surround the defining question of LIS ethics, that of intellectual freedom.
Our core purpose is to connect people with information, but there are others who seek to limit information and prevent people from accessing it.
If we are to improve our community, to benefit all of our users, then we must at times fight for our ability to do so.
It is not enough to hold only ourselves to our values, if we allow our core purpose to be subverted by limitations and censorship.
While it is simple enough to say that we will not limit access to anyone, it is much harder to take direct action to preserve and even gain access for those who do not have it.
The promotion of intellectual freedom against those who would remove it is necessary and vital if our core purpose of connecting _all_ users to _any_ information, in order to benefit the _entire_ community, it to be preserved.

LIS history is founded on the preservation and availability of information, so that it can be of benefit to more than just the people who created it.
This principle has expanded to all people, all information available, for the benefit of the entire community.
Our values are constantly changing and being updated, based on how we view the world and what we know of the people within it.
Our ethics are in constant conflict as we struggle to keep these values in the face of innumerable challenges to the community and to the intellectual freedom of everyone within it.
It all comes back to that core purpose, and the reason for that purpose is in the improvement of our world around us.
Going forward, as we continue to adapt, this core remains the same.

##Preparation and Evidence##

I have been developing and trying to understand my own personal values and ethics for most of my life, of course, and as a constant library user the common LIS stance in support of intellectual freedom has long been in the background.
I first consciously took note of the active role libraries had in this conflict shortly after the signing of the USA PATRIOT act.
I heard of libraries, such as those described in @Penenberg_dont04 who were deliberately subverting the purpose of the law while complying with the letter of it, in order to protect the rights of their patrons.
I was impressed by the lengths to which librarians would go to preserve the intellectual freedom of their clients, and this has inspired me to more deeply consider my own beliefs and the actions I willing to take to preserve them.

With this in mind, I have chosen three pieces of evidence to show how I have developed in this competency, and how it has informed the work I have done in the MLIS.
The first is a series of discussion posts from my first semester of classes, in which I discuss my views of several aspects of library service.
The second is a unified essay giving an overview of some of the greatest challenges, as I see them, facing public libraries.
The third is a more detailed essay in which I delve in to circumstances facing libraries when they are required to filter internet use for teen patrons, and the balance that must be struck between their ideals and the reality of the law.

###First Piece of Evidence: Discussion Posts, LIBR 200###

In the Fall of 2011 I began my coursework for the MLIS, and in the Introduction to Library and Information Science I received my first formal introduction to the ethical questions and dilemmas that face LIS professionals every day.
Throughout the course my fellow students and myself would discuss articles and the situations they described, offering our opinions on the actions that could and should be taken.
There was particular concern in the posts I have chosen regarding the effects and consequences of the USA PATRIOT act, and the intellectual freedom and confidentiality of library users as a result.
Even within this one course, my opinion was still developing, as it has continued to do since, showing that there are often no easy answers to the questions LIS professionals must confront.

At first, my opinions were rather straightforward, supporting user freedom and access and opposing invasive DRM and government searches.
This became more complicated in later weeks, however, when a situation arose that made me rethink the privacy and confidentiality of patrons.
As described in an article cited in the post, shortly after September 11, 2001, a librarian reported two of her patrons to the FBI when she recognized them from the list of terrorists involved in the attack, and specifically she reported the library computers they had used, which were then seized and searched by the authorities.
The question, then, is whether she was right to do this, or if she was wrong.
Did she uphold her duty to those attacked by leading investigators to the attackers, or did she violate her ethics as a librarian by divulging their use of information resources?
Almost in spite of myself, I found myself in the minority at the time in supporting her actions.
Though I had and still have very strong beliefs about information use and the government's right to seize it, I felt in this specific case that the librarian in question did not violate that principle, since she reported _known_ terrorists and not simply suspicious behavior or usage.
It is a subtle difference, and I have gone back and forth on this opinion several times since.

I was able to articulate my beliefs int his regard a bit better toward the end of the semester, when the class was asked specifically if librarians should consider patron records and their information use as privileged.
I realized here that there was a difference between ideals and what we want to be true, and the law and what is actually true.
From a purely ideal standpoint, then yes, there should be privilege.
Library patrons should never feel like they should not seek out information because of fear that they will be exposed and embarrassed or worse for it.
From a purely practical point of view, however, librarians do not _have_ privilege with their patrons, and in particular do not have the legal protections that true privilege confers.
Legally, librarians _can_ be compelled to answer questions about their patrons, and can be punished if they do not do so.
Information professionals must weigh for themselves their ideals for complete intellectual freedom and privacy, against the reality that they may still have to face consequences for acting on those ideals.

As stated, I still struggle with this question.
I do believe that privacy and privilege are of vital importance, but I have not yet been tested with how far I am willing to go to uphold that belief.
There is a constant conflict between the need for freedom and the need for security, and librarians, as guardians and purveyors or information of all kinds, are right at the center of that conflict.
Going forward, I will continue to develop my own personal ethics in this matter, and weigh my beliefs and choices against those of my fellow information professionals as this dichotomy continues to evolve.

###Second Piece of Evidence: Report on Library Challenges, LIBR 232###

In the Spring of 2013 I took part in a survey course addressing Issues in Public Libraries, which had a particular focus on the difficulty of balancing ideals with practical realities.
For one report late in the semester, I took it upon myself to describe what I saw as the most important challenges facing libraries as we move deeper into the Twenty-First Century.
Within this paper I synthesized many of the thoughts and dilemmas I had faced regarding this balance, and did my best to articulate my thoughts so far.
This paper represents my most current work in this area, up until the creation of this E-Portfolio.

Of particular concern for me is the issue of equal access for all users, an issue that I have revisited throughout my MLIS work.
It is often accepted without question now that prejudice and bigotry has no place in any civilized environment, and that all patrons should be treated equally in their pursuit of knowledge.
Unfortunately, this is often paired with the belief that equal access is a _reality_, that it has already been achieved in most library settings.
This is, however, far from the truth.
In this paper I bring up, not for the first time in my career, the unequal service often received by young adults, and patrons of all ages with disabilities.
Prejudice must be recognized and acknowledged before it can be fought, and too many people simply assume that they treating everyone how they should be treated.
It has become a mission of mine to recognize unconscious prejudice and inequality, and do what I can to eliminate it from library service.

I also address the difficulties faced by libraries when they are put under pressure from outside, an all too common situation.
Many of the ethical dilemmas faced by libraries could become non-issues if libraries were left to govern themselves, though of course they are not and this is not possible.
Even with every librarian and other worker on board for a particular ideal, it can become a conflict anyway when someone outside the library, but with power or influence over it, opposes that ideal.
Just as one common example, call for censorship and challenges to books almost never come from within the library, but rather from parents and government watchdogs outside.
Libraries, especially public libraries, are dependant upon funding, government oversight, and the goodwill of their community in order to function, and sometimes sticking to our ideals can put these into jeopardy.
While I remain committed to the need for freedom of access, privacy of patrons, and a lack of censorship, the fact remains that those ideals must be balanced against the greater evil of losing _all_ access if the library itself comes under fire.

The key takeaway I have found throughout my MLIS career, and articulated in this paper in particular, is that there are no easy answers.
Ideals would not need to be ideals if they were not in conflict with some other practice.
We would not need to speak of equal access if everyone already had it.
We would not need to fight for intellectual freedom if there was no such thing as censorship.
Our ideals must be fought for, but we must remember that those we fight may still have power over us, and some fights cannot be completely won.
When that is the case, we must decide if it is more important to keep to our ethics in the face of all opposition, or to compromise so that we can maintain the highest possible benefit for the most users.

###Third Piece of Evidence: Paper on Internet Filtering for Teen Patrons, LIBR 261A###

I have found myself becoming an advocate for equal treatment of teens and young adults in their use of library materials and services.
This is in large part due to the influence of the course on Programming and Services for Young Adults I attended during the Fall of 2012.
Many of the major ethical issues faced by LIS professionals seem to come into play when dealing with young adults, and any decision involving services for teens seems certain to invite controversy one way or the other.
Teen must deal with stricter rules, reduced service, all-but-mandatory censorship, and sometimes just plain bad behavior and dismissive attitudes about themselves and their service needs.
For this assignment, I chose internet censorship as one such topic to explore, in the form of a recommendation for action to a library board.

There are, in fact, several arguments to be made in favor of filtering internet use for teens.
First is the simple idea that many of the teens' parents, taxpayers and patrons who support the library and deserve to have a say in how it is run, specifically want filtering in place in order to limit the possibly harmful content that can be accessed by their children.
There is some research to suggest that increased exposure to adult content can by harmful to teens, increasing deviant and antisocial behavior.
Finally, there is the law.
The Children's Internet Protection Act _requires_ some level of internet filtering and censorship on computers that can be used by minors.
All of these arguments must be considered.

Of course, there is plenty to be said _against_ internet filtering as well.
First, familiar to all librarians, are the core ethical values espoused by the ALA and other organizations which advocate for the opposition of any and all censorship.
There is also the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, again arguing for the free expression of any information.
Regarding actual research, there is at least as much study showing _no_ harmful effects on minors from exposure to adult websites, and none of the studies either way are very conclusive.
The law remains the law, however, and public libraries that choose not to follow the requirements of CIPA may find themselves unable to continue to function at all.
For the purposes of this paper, as a hypothetical recommendation of action, I suggested following the requirements of CIPA, but _only_ the bare minimum requirements, in order to allow as much free access as possible without compromising our ability to function.

Practicality often ends up being my final choice on any of these ethical matters.
I want nothing more than to be a shining beacon of freedom and open access to information, but this is always tempered in reality with what must be done in order to maintain a high level of service.
I still maintain, though, that is necessary to fight those battles as much as possible.
Compromise when needed, but only when needed, and always with an eye toward reversing that compromise if possible i order to reinstate the freedoms that were lost.
Teens are a common target for censorship and "protection," and as such they are one of the groups most in need of advocacy from LIS professionals.

##Future Application##

The matter of ethics and values, freedom versus limitation, is one that will never be finished.
I maintain that it is my core purpose, as an information professional, to connect all users to the information that they require, and that this service will benefit those users and the community as a whole.
Sometimes I am sure that this purpose will be opposed by the realities and requirements of the position and organization in which I find myself.
While it may sometimes be necessary to compromise my values, it should never become _acceptable_ to do so.
Every privilege lost, every freedom closed, and every piece of information that is blocked or censored must be fought for, and fought for again if the opportunity ever presents itself.
Any setback should be considered as temporary, and I will advocate for them to be reversed throughout my coming career.
