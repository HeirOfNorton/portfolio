Competency H
------------

#Each graduate of the Master of Library and Information Science program is able to demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies.#

##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

We live in an Information Age, with information technology changing daily and almost constantly revolutionizing some part of daily life.
It is small wonder, then, that _information_ professionals are at the forefront of these changes.
More than almost any other field, Library and Information Science is constantly challenged and changed my new and emerging technology, while still staying rooted in principles and practices that are over a century old.
To stay current and relevant, an information professional must stay up to date with technology that may, and almost certainly will, affect the way that LIS work is done.
As always, though, this technology should be embraced only as long as the core principles of keeping users first and most important can be maintained.

##Preparation and Evidence##

I have almost always felt comfortable with new and changing technology, as I was using computers regularly before there was such a thing as the World Wide Web.
I do find, though, that I have begun falling behind the most current of technology.
I do not even have a smartphone.
Nonetheless, I am certain I can continue to adapt.
With this in mind, I have chosen three pieces of evidence to demonstrate my comfort and mastery of this competency.
The first is an overview of some of the challenges facing public libraries, as brought up during discussion posts throughout a semester.
The second is an in depth review of the needs and difficulties surrounding the use and lending of E-Books in libraries.
The third is an evaluation and comparison of two online research guides.

###First Piece of Evidence: Discussion Posts, LIBR 204###

During my course on Information Management, from the Fall of 2011, there was a great deal of discussion about the place of new technologies and how they were altering information organizations and the services they provide.
Many different aspects of library management, from library marketing to reference service, to the very way users interact with the library itself, have been changing thanks to new technologies and their adoption.
Throughout the semester, in the online discussion posts for the class, I chose and briefly explored several of the changes that were being made to libraries in this way.
With all of them, I concluded that change may be difficult and frightening, but it is necessary and in many ways can make our jobs easier.

One of the simplest ways that information technology can affect a library is with its website.
Websites in themselves can no longer be considered new or emerging technology, but the underlying systems behind them are still developing and advancing, and library websites must keep abreast of these changes or risk losing relevance and effectiveness entirely.
A library's web page is one of its most visible and potentially most effective marketing tools, as I discuss with regards to the website of my local public library.
A web page using outdated standards and technology will tell users that the library is outdated, but at the same time a web page must have useful and relevant content, ideally showcasing the available programs and services at the library.
A balance must be struck between flash and substance, but both are needed for an effective web page.

In a later week, during a discussion on library budgets, I point out how new technologies can automate and streamline many of the expensive and tedious processes that a library must perform.
The Queens public library, as an example, uses automated systems so that users can check out materials themselves, freeing librarians for reference and other services that need a human touch.
The Roseville Library in my own neighborhood also uses automatic checkout, as well as RFID tagging to better keep track of inventory and theft, reducing the costs of both systems so that more of the limited budget can go towards needed services.

In the following, I brought up what I believe to be one of the most interesting of emerging technologies, the phenomenon called Augmented Reality.
Augmented Reality is a kind of program, usually an app on a smartphone, that allows users to basically annotate and comment on the world around them, and to share these comments with one another.
It can be used to overlay maps and directions on top of the view through a phone's camera, with reviews of the shops visible in the frame.
It can be used to connect news stories to the locations that they discuss, in real time and right in front of the user.
In the case of library service, it could be used to display upcoming events over the library, or to comment on the materials help by the library.
@Hahn_mobile12 is a recent article describing some of the services that could be added or improved with Augmented Reality.

Almost any new information technology can, and likely will, see use in a library or other information organization.
With these discussions, I have started to see some of the ways in which library service can change in response.
More importantly, perhaps, is that I have started to see how these new technologies can be applied to improve service, and to make work easier (or at least cheaper) for information professionals.
These technologies may be unavoidable, but often they should be embraced for the benefits they offer to an information organization.

###Second Piece of Evidence: E-Books in Public Libraries Paper, LIBR 266###

The most thorough and in-depth work I have had on different kinds of collections and library items was during the Spring of 2013, in a class on Collection Development.
This included a great deal of discussion about digital materials and collections, most obviously E-Books and the speed in which they are growing in popularity.
Ever since the introduction of the Kindle and its clones, E-Books have exploded in use compared to physical books, thanks to their low cost and convenience, and libraries have struggled to keep up.
They are often stymied, though, by systems put in place that make it extra difficult for libraries to make use of E-Books.
For my final term paper in this class, I chose to explore in depth the challenges, frustrations, and consequences of offering E-Books for lending within a library.

One problem I explore is one of marketing and promotion.
Most users are not even aware that libraries have E-Books available, even if they are regular purchasers of E-Books themselves, a problem described by @Buczynski_Library10.
Even if they are aware of them, most clients are infrequent users of library E-Books due to long wait lines and limited available copies, assuming the books they wish to borrow are available from the library at all.
Many users do not understand the specific rights and availability of E-Books that are imposed by publishers, and become frustrated or confused when an electronic file is "checked out" to someone else, even though the files they have on their own computers are usually easily copied however they like.
Even worse is when a library runs out of "check-outs", and cannot lend the book at all.

Most of the big publishers seem dead-set against E-Book lending in libraries, leading to many of these problems.
Two of the big publishers outright refuse to allow E-Books in the library at all, which leads to many popular titles being noticeably absent in a library's E-Book collection.
While others do allow E-Books to be lent, usually through a third party service like Overdrive, they nonetheless impose strict and apparently arbitrary limits.
Generally, libraries may only lend out an E-Book a certain number of times before it must be repurchased, supposedly to emulate the way that physical books will wear out and need to be repurchased.
However, these limits are in practice much lower than the number of lendings a physical book can endure, especially since libraries will often mend worn books to extend their life, and even worse, some publishers charge libraries _more_ for their E-Books than for a physical copy of the same book, despite the almost nonexistent production costs.
Small wonder, then, that some libraries simply refuse the hassle of carrying these E-Books.

The solution I prefer, as I describe in the article, would be to stop treating E-Books as equivalent to physical books, purchased one at a time.
Better, I think, would be to introduce a subscription model where library systems would purchase an entire catalog of books at once, but only for a limited amount of time.
Within that time, though, their patrons could borrow whichever books they like, however often the like.
A system like this would be familiar to most libraries, who already use this model for their subscriptions to journals and article databases.
It would also be familiar and understandable to most consumers thanks to the popularity of services like Netflix and Hulu.
There would be some logistical problems to work out, not the least of them how to keep track of purchases for author royalties, but these are problems that can be solved, while providing a better experience for users.

Unfortunately, no one in the E-Book publishing industry is listening to me yet.
Still, the problems involved with E-Books in libraries are problems that can be solved, though it may be some time before enough people can separate E-Books away from physical books in their thoughts in order to implement the solutions.
Either way, E-Books are a part of the library ecosystem, now, and I will do what I can to offer them to my clients in as simple and convenient a way as I can.
The convenience and popularity of E-Books for readers, and their ever increasing profits and market share for booksellers and publishers, mean that they are here to stay, and will only become a larger part of patrons' information needs.
All we can do, for now, is try to keep up.

###Third Piece of Evidence: LibGuide Evaluation Project, LIBR 228###

For this last piece of evidence, I explore a new version of an old system.
For my Advanced Reference Services course in the Fall of 2012, I evaluated two online reference guides, or LibGuides, for usefulness and usability.
While research guides and pathfinders have existed in libraries for decades, the development of the internet and more recent advances in web-building technology have breathed new life into the format.
Recent innovations in "Web 2.0" (or "3.0") allow for a more intuitive and more collaborative experience when using research guides, if the guides make use of these innovations.
Unfortunately, the LibGuides that I reviewed do not take advantage of the better technology available.

Of course, the most important criteria for judging a research guide is whether or not it is usable, regardless of how "modern" it may be.
From an aesthetic and technical point of view, both of these LibGuides do "okay" but not very well, missing out on several important usability guidelines as described by @HFE_letting10.
The pages are cluttered, long, and packed with information but little guidance.
Even from the point of view of students within the discipline, the LibGuides both have too many resources simply listed without comment, with no evaluation of which are better or more useful.
A LibGuide must first be a usable web page before it can be upgraded to a modern and innovative web page.

The LibGuide software used for these research guides is a modern and well-engineered piece of software, and librarians can make websites that feel both usable and current if they take advantage of what it has to offer.
The most current web technology allows for user-generated content and collaboration, making any page a community effort.
In keeping with this same sense of community, modern web pages are interconnected with social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, allowing users to discuss the site while at the same time becoming its greatest advocates.
Modern websites also allow the user to be connected through other means, by way of apps on their phone or tablet, and will sync up with the users other apps to offer services and content that would not otherwise be possible.
Though none of this is automatic, happening for free, todays younger users expect such interconnectedness, and accommodating them can help not only market the library, but also offer better service for the users.

I still having only a passing familiarity with most social networking platforms, though I am learning, and right now I would not be able to build a LibGuide that connects to them on my own.
However, I do at least know that they are there, and I know the advantages of leveraging their power to give better service for our users.
These platforms, if nothing else, are an invaluable marketing resource that no library can afford to ignore if they wish to compete with the countless other information and entertainment sources jockeying for attention.
I plan, for now, to improve my knowledge of how to use social media to connect with users, and let them know the services my organization can offer them.

##Future Application##

The simple fact of the matter is that information technology is always changing, rapidly, and information services must always play catch up.
It is vital that we do so, however, or we risk being left behind or replaced by something that is newer and brighter, and that probably has cat pictures.
By its very nature, though, all information technology can and should have a home within information services, as they are simply different parts of the same whole that do not need to be kept separate.
I am still learning what I can about these technologies, and I am always amazed by the new things they can do, but I am more concerned with what _I_ can do _with_ them in service of my patrons.
My goal as always is to connect my users to the information they as best I can, and advances in information technology offer new and often better ways to do just that.
