Personal and Professional Strengths
-----------------------------------

I began this MLIS program with a work history outside of LIS service, but which has prepared me with several strengths that will serve me well in the future.
I am good at directing a team, leading them in the fulfillment of a project or a service, and pushing forward until the job is done.
This includes the interaction and communication skills needed to get everyone on the same page, even past personality conflicts and rivalries.
Moreover, I have the will to take this strength and use it to advocate for better service for everyone, especially underserved populations like people with developmental disabilities.

My sales and customer service experience has helped to prepare me for the skills I need to connect users with the information they need, in particular at the reference desk.
Though I am not yet familiar with all of the major resources used to answer reference questions, I have the right attitude and mindset, and I know how to conduct a reference interview to find out what information they need.
I am an expert in client interaction, with both questioning and "problem" patrons, and I am prepared for all comers.

Finally, I am quite strong in the technical concepts that underlie much of the information profession.
I can internalize the details of cataloging and classification, and I understand the purposes of metadata and metadata standards.
Though I have not yet memorized every MARC code or MODS tag, I have a strong foundation for the principles involved in these standards, and I can apply them to the processing of real-world records and documents.
My strong technical and computer background has prepared me for the development and application of these formats.

Plan for Professional Growth
----------------------------

Though my degree is nearly finished, my education is still very much in progress.
There are many aspects of Library and Information Science for which this coursework has only scratched the surface, and others for which I know from experience that I can improve.
Perhaps first I should develop better time management skills; though I have always been able to complete my work by whatever deadline is imposed, more often than not that work is completed right _on_ the deadline.
This is a flaw with which I have struggled most of my life, and it is clear by now that is not going to just "get better" on its own.

I would like to better understand how to apply learning theories and strategies to the instructional programs that I conduct.
Most of skill in this area has been learned by trial and error, and while the classes I teach are usually effective, this is more by accident than by design.
I expect training and instruction to continue as a large part of my career, and indeed to probably grow, I feel it is vital for me to learn how to do it better and with a more thorough understanding of _why_ certain techniques are better.

From a practical point of view, I need to learn more of the details of cataloging and classification, as even the one class I took is falling away out of disuse.
This sort of skill must be constantly nurtured and refreshed, not least because the standards involved are often changing.
Ideally, I would like to receive an internship, or even a job, in which I can practice and learn these skills even better than I have them now.

I intend to become more familiar with modern social media and related technology, as my knowledge of these important marketing tools is woefully out of date.
I have a Facebook account that I hardly use, and my phone is decidedly "dumb" rather than smart.
However, I have a strong knowledge of computers that should give me a step up in the right direction.
One of my goals for the winter is to build and _understand_ my social media profiles, so that I can transfer this experience into my LIS career.

I have been on a long journey toward the MLIS degree, but as I have repeated, this is only the beginning of my career, not the end.
My education and development will never be fully complete, will never truly end, just as they don't for anyone who is dedicated to improving themselves.
I look forward to putting what I have learned into practice, and I look forward to figuring out just which parts of my education still have gaps.
I still hold to the philosophy that my core purpose as a LIS professional will be to connect all users to the information they need.
I have gained some skills and knowledge that will help me fulfill that purpose, and I will never stop as long as that purpose remains to be done.
