Competency C
------------

#Each graduate of the Master of Library and Information Science program is able to recognize and describe cultural and economic diversity in the clientele of libraries or information organizations.#

##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

For any institution that serves multiple people, there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution.
People come from many different backgrounds and with many different needs, and as a result people will need different kinds of services to meet those needs.
Some of these differences are obvious and easy to see, such as differences in race or nationality.
Others can be much more subtle, such as economic background and mental ability.
Other differences can be easy to see, but are often not recognized as important differences, such as age.
Still, all of these differences and more affect the needs of the person, and the services that may be provided for them.
Most important, however, is recognizing that, while these differences may change the nature of the service offered, it should never change the quality of service offered, and that all patrons are valuable and deserving of equal treatment.

##Preparation and Evidence##

While I have been vaguely aware of the problems of prejudice and the need to recognize diversity for all of my life, I first noticed how this diversity must affect service during when I was an undergraduate.
There, I tutored other students by helping to write and edit papers and essays for their classes.
I found I had to adapt my tutoring style quite a lot students with different native languages, students from different economic backgrounds, and a few students who had special needs.
I became even more aware of these differences after I began working in retail in an area with a large immigrant population.
Different people wanted different things, but they also expected different service from me, and I have to constantly adapt myself to fit the customer in front of me.
The biggest wake up call, however, was after I was diagnosed with a developmental disability, and from there became much more aware not only of the service I offered, but of the service that was offered to _me_.
I now pay a great deal of attention to the attitudes and assumptions made by people around me in the service that they give, whether ti is to me or to someone else.

I have chosen three projects to demonstrate my mastery of this competency.
The first is a narrative of my experience "walking" the neighborhood around a library branch, observing the different demographics that must be served by that library.
The second is a comparison of articles that demonstrate different views of teen and young adult patrons, critiquing the assumptions and opinions shown.
The third is a research paper in which I analyze the state of services for persons with developmental disabilities in libraries today.

###First Piece of Evidence: "Walking" A Local Neighborhood, LIBR 266###

The course I took on Collection Development in the Spring of 2013 was very concerned with the diverse need of different groups of users.
We students were constantly reminded to be aware that the collection was not for one group, but for many.
One of our first projects was to literally walk through the neighborhood around a local library and observe the different demographics of people who lived there, and to speculate on the collection needs of the library that serves them.
In my work as a retail supervisor, I had already seen the enormous variety of people that can be served by a single institution, but in that context I was nearly always simply reacting to the people I met, and rarely planning ahead to serve them.
This project helped me to think strategically about the diverse needs of my community.

The main point of this project was to observe the diversity of the neighborhood, which I took to heart.
I began at a major shopping center just north of the library I chose, the busiest part of the neighborhood, and worked my way south into the city of St. Paul.
As I had noticed before, the mall had an large variety of people from different economic situations and different countries.
The neighborhood itself, while not as obviously diverse as the mall, nonetheless showed several distinct groups, with visible economic trends from the wealthier neighborhood on the north end to a poorer area when getting closer to the city.
Age groups also changed, with more middle aged or older people living alone in the north to younger families to the south.
All of these groups would need to be accounted for in the development of services at the library in the middle.

The second part of the project was to speculate on the collection needs of the different people observed in the neighborhood.
At the mall I saw a large number of immigrants to the state, especially Hmong and Somali people, which suggests a need for ESL services or materials in those languages.
As I went south, I saw different areas with both older citizens and younger children, suggesting a need for a strong children's department but without sacrificing services aimed at adults such as computer literacy instruction.
I saw a change in neighborhoods as well both in racial make-up and wealth, all within the area served by this one library.
While the project itself was focussed on development of the library collection, other services go hand-in-hand with the collection, and it was clear to me that there could be no one-size-fits-all solution or set of services for the library.

I did also see, however, that there are limits to the use of simply observing a neighborhood without any deep study.
I did observe a large number of immigrants at the shopping mall, but I saw almost none while walking the area itself.
Similarly, while I saw a large number of African-American families as I got closer to St. Paul, there seemed to be far fewer as a part of all people at the mall near the library.
As well, simple observation gives no hint about how likely any one group is to use the library.
According to recent census data, African-American households are more likely to use the library [@GD_households07], but this could be different in this area.
Walking a neighborhood is a start to learning the diversity of that area, but it is nowhere near the end.

I did learn that there is some value in walking around the neighborhood to see what sorts of people live there and would need service from a library or institution nearby.
I new some of the make-up of the area from working at the mall myself, but saw a very different picture just from moving a few blocks south.
However, I also saw that such observations will still be biased in some way, and cannot be used as the main method to determine what variety of services are needed.
Local census data and direct surveys would be much stronger evidence, both to see who is there and who is using (or could be using) the library in question.
It is, however, a start, one I intend to employ in the future in order to maintain awareness of the diversity of people served by my institution.
In order to serve a community, it is necessary to know who is living in that community.

###Second Piece of Evidence: Visions of Youth Paper, LIBR 261A###

In the Fall of 2012, I took a course on services and collections specifically for teen and young adult patrons.
In this course, the instructor had a strong focus on how these patrons were seen (or ignored) by the adults who are in charge of their lives, and in the adults who are supposed to be serving them in institutions like libraries.
The projects and study of the course were often less about specific materials or services, and more about attitudes about service, encouraging the equal treatment of teens when the usually do not receive it.
Teens often have fewer rights, fewer resources, and fewer options than our adult patrons, and librarians should be aware of those biases and attempt to overcome them.
One project, a paper comparing different analyses of attitudes and actions towards youth, brings this conflict to the forefront.

I chose this because it has become clear to me that not all kinds of diversity among library clientele are obvious.
Some differences between patrons are clear.
Patrons who speak different languages will have different needs from a library.
A patron wearing a three-piece suit will probably need a different kind of service from one wearing a hoody and jeans.
In many situations, though, and in many libraries, this has not been extended to teens.
Youth are often lumped together with younger children, sometimes lumped together with adults, and either way are almost always lumped together as one single homogeneous group themselves.
This paper was one way in which I explored the limitations of that attitude.

Both authors that I review trace ways in with teens have been marginalized or even demonized by adults and institutions throughout recent history, and how these attitudes have led to services that seek to control youth more than to serve them.
Though the works reviewed do not specifically link this to libraries, I do connect this trend to the common modern library that often has more rules for teens than any other group, and zero-tolerance for breaking these arbitrary rules.
One author describes the prevailing attitude as needing to "fix" teens, that they are somehow broken or inherently wrong, while the other author sees it as teens being infantalized, treated as weaker and needing protection, but either way it leads to teens being limited and controlled in ways that adults are not.
It is one of the few kinds of prejudice that is still largely practiced and accepted in the modern world, though many are beginning to question its validity.

Both authors wish for these prejudices to be ended, and for teens to have equal rights and services as adults.
I agree, though with the caveat that equal does not mean treating teens as identical to adults.
Teens often need and want different materials and different services than their adult peers, and that should be reflected in the services offered at a library or other information organization.
A well-run library would have specialized services for any significant population in its service area, such as a large foreign language section tailored to the languages spoken in its neighborhood, or strong job-search services in a neighborhood with high unemployment.
In the same way, a library with a significant teen population (which includes nearly all public libraries) should have services dedicated tot hat population, without treating it as anything less important than any other service.

What I took away from this project is that I must be careful about any assumptions I have about my patrons, about the services they want and the services they deserve.
When trying to stay aware of the diversity of my patrons and their needs, I cannot limit this awareness to only the obvious and well-known kinds of diversity.
Teens and young adults, as just one example, often have fewer services and more rules than other patrons, but this dichotomy often goes unexamined, and it is just assumed to be proper.
Anything that can be used to differentiate people from one another can be a source of prejudice, and any differences in service based on these should be examined and explored to make sure all patrons are treated as equals.
Just as I was forced to examine my own attitudes toward teens with this project, I will endeavor to stay aware of my attitude toward any group that I serve in the future.

###Third Piece of Evidence: Patrons with Developmental Disabilities Paper, LIBR 200###

Seven years ago I discovered that I fit all of the symptoms for Asperger's Syndrome, and I received an official diagnosis several months later.
Since that time I have had a strong interest in developmental disabilities, as well as the attitudes people have towards them and the accommodations different institutions make or fail to make for the people who have them.
In the Fall on 2011 I began my classes for the MLIS, and in the Introduction to Library and Information Services course that semester I was required to write a significant research paper.
With my interest, I began researching library services for people with developmental disabilities, and discovered that the state of things today is rather disappointing.
I chose this as my topic then, and I chose the resulting paper for this competency now, because people with developmental disabilities are still very underserved in library and information settings, and this is one very large area of diversity that should be acknowledged.

Developmental disabilities are sometimes called "invisible" disabilities, in that there is often no physical sign that a person has such a disability.
People running institutions and deciding on services to offer often do not even think about people with developmental disabilities, and as a result offer few if any services or even accommodations for people who have them.
My research uncovered that most libraries have little or no training specifically for helping people with developmental disabilities, and indeed that often people with developmental disabilities did not use the library because it did not offer anything for them.
This is in contrast to other research showing the strong benefits of offering such service for the community.
I know from experience, and the research confirmed, that people with developmental disabilities are often shy and embarrassed to disclose that they have one.
An open mind and positive attitude, with service specifically for the benefit of people with developmental disabilities, can help them grow into better and happier people.

For the most part, people with developmental disabilities require the same service as anyone who is neurotypical.
There are, however, certain changes that can be made to improve services and make libraries more welcoming.
As one example, people with mental retardation have a great deal of difficulty finding materials suitable for them.
Adult materials are often too difficult to read, but children's materials do not have the kind of subject matter that they are interested in reading.
Children with autism spectrum disorders benefit from a reading environment that is different from one used for neurotypical children, with fewer distractions and less noise.
For one more example, people with ADHD or Autism disorders appreciate from services that are much more ordered and regimented than the other parts of their life, and benefit from programs that help teach time management skills.
I learned quite a few practical ways to improve library services, and a few ways to improve my own life, and there are many more ways that I can still learn.

Most of the articles I consulted suggested that the most important change to be made in any institution is one of attitude.
Many people have negative, or at best condescending, opinions about people with developmental disabilities, informed by limited and often negative portrayals in the media.
They think that people with autism disorders or ADHD simply have a bad attitude or are faking it, they think any developmental disability is the same as being "retarded", and they equate retardation---real or imagined---with being stupid.
I have seen this in my own interactions with people, and I am very hesitant to tell people about my own disability because of it.
I have certainly become more aware of the diversity of people with these disabilities since my own diagnosis, and now try to never prejudge a person based on their ability.

I learned with this research that I am not alone in feeling that there are few if any library services aimed at people like me.
Before beginning this project, I was roughly aware of the problems faces by people with Asperger's Syndrome simply from my own experience, but I became aware of the same sort of problems faced by people with other developmental disabilities, and in much more detail.
I, however, will be in a position to affect this problem.
In my career going forward, I will use this research to raise awareness among my coworker of the variety of patrons who have developmental disabilities, and the ways in which we can better serve them.
I now have specific evidence of the benefits of offering services for people with developmental disabilities.
More importantly, though, I have the drive to see people with developmental disabilities treated equally with other patrons, and to adapt services to include them.

##Future Application##

I think that the key to this competency is awareness.
I must always be aware of the differences between people, of the attitude I project toward people, of the service they expect, and of the service I am giving.
For cultural and economic diversity, I cannot assume I know who I am serving simply by what I see, especially since I may not be serving all populations that I could be.
I have also become aware of the way people of different ages and abilities are treated, some quite negatively, and I have already found myself treating more people with more respect as a result.
In my career going forward, I intend to make sure any place I work treats all of its patrons as equal and valuable members of the community.
I will endeavor to never assume, at any point, that I know what a client wants, needs, or deserves based only on what I can see of them, and will always treat people with respect and discover what services they need from them.
