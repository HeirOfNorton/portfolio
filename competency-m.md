Competency M
------------

#Each graduate of the Master of Library and Information Science program is able to demonstrate oral and written communication skills necessary for professional collaboration and presentations.#

##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

Rare indeed is the librarian or information professional who always works alone.
Most of us, however, work as part of a team, sometimes a very large one.
Successful teamwork requires successful communication, so that everyone knows not only what needs to be done, but who is doing what.
As well, we do not always get to pick the people with whom we are partnered, so we must learn how to collaborate even when there are personality conflicts and rivalries.
Another important skill, related to collaboration and often combined with it, is the ability to conduct a presentation.
While professional communication among peers is often conversational, between individuals, presentations are usually one sided, an individual communicating with a passive group.
Both skills are necessary for information professionals.

##Preparation and Evidence##

I have quite a lot of experience working as part of a group or team, both as the team leader and as a single equal member.
As a retail supervisor, I need to communicate with team members as part of a group project nearly every day, and I have seen first hand the consequences that can occur if there is a breakdown in communication.
Projects have failed, or simply gone wrong, when people did not listen to one another, did not speak clearly to one another, or assumed that everyone was on the same page without confirming.
This communication is both oral, spoken one-on-one, and often written in the form of emails.
I have less experience with presentations, as indeed the only times I have ever given a presentation have been in school.
However, many of the concepts needed for a successful presentation are common with other skills, such as my experience giving Public Address announcements, or conducting morning team meetings, so I would not be flying blind when giving a presentation.

I have chosen two pieces of evidence---one of them encompassing two files---to demonstrate my mastery of this competency.
The first is an eLuminate recording of a PowerPoint presentation that I and my group gave, describing Web 2.0 resources for children and children's librarians.
The second piece of evidence is the supporting files from a large group project in which I participated to create an instructional blog.
The evidence includes a transcript of a chat session we held, and my personal self assessment of our group's final project and how we worked together.

###First Piece of Evidence: Web 2.0 Children's Resources [presentation], LIBR 260A###

I worked as a part of a group during my class on Programming and Services for Children, in the Spring of 2012.
Our assignment was to present a variety of resources under a single topic, in a way that related to services for children.
My team decided upon "Web 2.0 Resources", a survey of different modern web-based resources that are useful for children, and for children's librarians.
My contribution to the presentation was the first major section, starting at 1:00 minute into the recording of the presentation, which was a listing and discussion of research resources for children.
I chose a variety of sources, from general portals like _Yahoo! Kids_ to subject specific sites such as _NASA for Kids_, all with an eye toward resources that were interesting, useful, and aimed at children without talking down to them.

Our group worked well together, though much of our work was done separately and only brought together at the end.
By this point, I had been a team lead at my day job for several years, and I was quite content to let Jessica take the lead in our group so that I could concentrate on my own part without worrying about keeping everyone on track.
The only direct collaboration my team really did was at the very beginning, choosing the topic and splitting up the responsibility, and toward the end when all of our parts had to be joined together into a single presentation.
We did critique one another's slides so that the show could be consistent front to back, as well as each other's presentation technique, during our final practice run, but for most of the project we stayed apart and quietly supported one another.

For my section, as well as my feedback on the others' sections, I tried to make the slides visually interesting while keeping them clear of clutter.
I did my best to keep to the suggestions of @Wax_tips08, starting with his admonition to keep the focus on one thing at a time during the presentation.
I also followed his third suggestion of no paragraphs on screen, and discouraged my collaborators from including long winded text on the screen.
I was not able to keep images out of the presentation, but I believe I used images well, as I included screen shots of the resources I described so that the audience could see for themselves whether a resource appeared appealing or not.
I avoided flashy transitions and distracting fonts or graphics, to end up with a clear and concise appearance that is easy to read.

I also attempted to apply his advice about modulating my voice.
I actually have plenty of experience projecting my voice and keeping it clear and comfortable to hear, thanks to several years of practice making P.A. announcements at my work.
I brought this experience to the fore as much as I could, though despite my comfort using a Public Address system, I still get nervous when addressing an audience directly, even across several states through eLuminate, and I caught a few verbal tics sneaking their way into my speech.
I am still not sure if I would better or worse if I had to conduct a presentation live in front of an audience, but I am in no hurry to find out for sure.

Still, a few hiccups aside, this does demonstrate my ability to give presentations as part of a group.
I know how to speak more slowly so that I am less likely to stutter or fumble for words, and I can enunciate as well as project my voice to be heard clearly over a crowd and across a room.
Going forward, I would like additional experience so that I can avoid these verbal tics even better, and I have had some success practicing to myself, but I can never seem to get my pitch right without someone to hear me.
I will keep Wax's tips in mind, as well as any others I pick up, when I have to create a proposal or instructional program in my organization in the future.
A presentation is certainly not my preferred method of communicating, but it is one that I can accomplish.

###Second Piece of Evidence: Bibliographic Instruction Project (Chat Transcript and Group Self Assessment), LIBR 210###

Another group in which I participated, one with a much larger project and one that dealt with much greater challenges, was in my Introduction to Reference Services course, also from the Spring of 2012.
This was a very different experience to the one I had in my other class that semester, one I am still not eager to repeat.
Our group was assigned to create a Bibliographic Instruction Package, an online tool that could be used in reference services to teach aspects of some topic to a particular audience.
We, through much discussion back and forth, eventually settled on the creation of a blog on Tumblr with an instructional topic of writing research papers, with an intended audience of High School students.
The blog is not included here (and indeed it seems to have fallen off of Tumblr's servers at some point).
Instead I have included in this portfolio supporting documents created during out collaboration, including a transcript of one of our chat discussions, and my own self-assessment of our work and the group itself.

We faced several obstacles in our communication as a group over the course of our collaboration that semester.
Some of these were simply because of technical or scheduling issues.
The BlackBoard software we used would often misbehave, and both of my partners sometimes has other obligations, as did I.
During the first few weeks, at least one of us was missing for every chat session we scheduled, and indeed our strategic meeting several weeks into the term that is shown in the transcript was only the second time that the entire group was able to meet at once.
We used email and discussion board messages to coordinate with one another, but this was of course limited in that it was not immediate.
Several decisions about the direction of the group and its project had to be made in those first weeks with one of the team missing, and the hope that the decision made would be okay.

Most of our direct communication was in chat, at least when we could all synchronize our schedules enough to meet up in the chat room.
I attempted to keep to the principles of professional communication in all of these chat sessions, though they were very informal.
@EW_management07 describes several of these principles, and the hold true whether the communication is formal or informal.
These chat sessions bear more in common with oral communication and conversation than any official writing, so I approached them this way.
I always make sure to "listen" to my peers, which can be difficult considering that chat is not perfectly synchronous, and I make sure to respond to anything that seems important so they know I am paying attention.
I tried to keep the conversation on topic, despite a great deal of drift.
I also did not get overcommitted to any particular idea, which was in fact an absolute necessity with this group, so I was able to move on and continue working past a decision that I did not agree with.
These skills kept my going despite occasional times when I was quite dissatisfied with the direction the group was going, when I was overruled by the rest of the group.

@EW_management07 stresses the importance of listening to one another when working in a team, and many of the problems I had in this group came from a lack of listening.
As I describe in the self assessment, one of the other team members would dominate to conversation and the direction that the blog ended up taking.
This person (whom I will not identify) would often dismiss or outright ignore anything the other two of us said to try to pull the project in a different direction, and as a result the final product was not what I would have preferred to create.
This team member did exactly what I would not allow myself to do, which was to become overcommitted to an idea of what the blog should be.
This was especially infuriating when the suggestions I made that were ignored were nothing more or less than the instructions given to us by our professor as part of the assignment, with the argument made that the suggestion was "boring".
As well, tis person also dominated and collaborative writing we shared, often deleting whole pages of another member's work and rewriting them without so much as a suggestion for improvement as a warning.
There is another support document---an assessment of another group's instruction package---that I cannot in good conscious include in this portfolio, as almost none of my own words remain in it any longer.
It was about this point that I determined that could only write my part of the project as best I can, and not worry about the rest.

The upshot of this experience, though, is that our group was still successful in creating the blog.
An important lesson for anyone who works in a team or a hierarchy is that, at some point, they will find themselves working on a project in which they no longer believe, or a project that is going in a direction in which they do not agree.
The easy way out of this would be to abandon the project, though of course for many people this is not an option.
Better, then, to state your position, do your best to honestly argue the direction you think is right, but be prepared to put in your highest level of work anyway, even if you do not succeed in changing direction.
Information professionals---any professionals, really---cannot afford to do their job only when they completely agree with it.
A vital part of professional communication and collaboration, then, is the ability to continue collaborating with people you do not like, do not agree with, or simply for any reason do not want to work with.

I showed that I can make use of this skill, as I have had to demonstrate in my own countless times.
I am sure, going forward, there will be more times when I do not think the work I am doing is the correct way to improve my organization.
I will defend these beliefs, and try to argue my superior over to my own point of view, but I have accepted the fact that sometimes---probably quite often, in fact---I will need to put that disagreement aside, along with any other biases I may have against a coworker, in order to do my job.
I owe it to myself and my organization to always perform to my highest ability even in these situations, as disagreement is no excuse for shoddy work.
I will never by that petty, or that shallow, and I will always do my best to raise the level of service in my organization even if I think a different service would be better.

##Future Application##

I have developed my oral and written communication skills over many years as part of several teams and groups and through the creation of many different projects.
That skill set will serve me as a central part of my occupation, I am sure, no matter what organization or institution I end up working for.
I do not know what sorts of collaborative work I will have to do in the future, or whether I will be leading it or simply one cog on the wheel, but I do know that communication will be needed either way, and I have come to understand over the year how professional communication is used.
Whether I am trying to convince a boardroom of a course of action, trying to convince a team that a particular service need to be improved, or trying to convince a six year old to come out from behind a shelving unit, these communication skills will ensure that I am understood and that I have given myself the best possible change to succeed.
