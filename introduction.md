Introduction
============

I began my journey to complete my MLIS over two years ago with my first classes at San Jose State University.
In that time I have learned more than I ever expected about library challenges, cataloging and database systems, the different kinds of information organizations, and above all, how best to serve my clients.
This electronic portfolio represents this journey, and shows my growth and development as I have learned and mastered each of the major aspect of library and information science.
I have been fortunate in the support I have received from my family and colleagues as I have walked this journey, and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done for me.

Each section of this E-Portfolio represents one of the major aspects of Library and Information science that students must master to earn their MLIS degree.
My approach in building these competencies was driven by the work I had already done throughout my coursework.
While I used previous assignments as evidence of my mastery of these competencies, I also considered them to be a prologue, early steps that are culminated in the statements contained in this portfolio.
The new work written here builds upon those earlier assignments, bridging the disparate tasks together and connecting them into a greater whole.
Though I often did not think of the assignments as connected when I first created them, I now see that they were simply separate steps on the same path toward the competencies of LIS work.

Several common themes showed themselves as I gathered these assignments together.
The most important, I believe, is my conviction and dedication to connection users to the information the need without bias or limit, a tenet that I have refined into what I call my core purpose as an information professional and articulated in my statement of Professional Philosophy.
Other themes I noticed include advocacy for the "invisible" patrons---young adults and people with developmental disabilities---who still do not always receive equal service from libraries, as well as a fondness, if not yet full expertise, in many of the technical aspect of library science.

I developed the final statements of competency by finding these themes, the aspects of my coursework that in retrospect feel the most vital to me, and using them as the kernel around which the rest of the statement grows.
In this way each statement calls back to the philosophy, and they all call back to one another, bridging them all together into a whole that is, in my opinion, greater than the sum of its parts.
As I look forward, already these same themes color my plans and intentions for my future and the career I will have.

Please look kindly on this portfolio as you look through the statements and the evidence that informs them.
It is the culmination of all of my MLIS work so far, but that "so far" is the important bit.
This portfolio, though the culmination of all of my coursework, nonetheless represents the beginning of my career, and not any sort of ending.
