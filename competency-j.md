Competency J
------------

#Each graduate of the Master of Library and Information Science program is able to describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors.#

##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

One of the core purposes of library and information science is to connect users to information, but it is difficult if not impossible to do that if we do not understand how our users search for that information in the first place.
Without understanding our users' behavior, we can only guess about what to do or how to search in such a way that we will find what they need, and recognize that we have found it.
People come to information professionals at all levels of information need, with different histories of how to search and what they have found.
When helping our clients, we need to know what level they are at, what they are comfortable finding on their own, and most importantly what their real information needs are, beyond simply what they have explicitly asked of us.
By understanding each client, what they need and expect, and what they are likely to have done already, we can better answer their information needs and better serve them in our profession.

##Preparation and Evidence##

I have observed the different ways that people seek information throughout my adult life, and more recently the different strategies that can be employed to help them fulfill those needs.
During my undergraduate studies I worked as a writing tutor, and saw for myself that many people conducted research at very different skill levels, and sometimes with very different strategies.
It was a struggle sometimes to articulate to them my own research strategies, and try to translate that into something they could use in their research later.
After graduation I entered retail, and saw more directly the different contexts and different levels of understanding that clients would have as they searched for something---in this case something to buy rather than something to learn, but otherwise very similar---and I also have learned that they have very different expectations of me and what I can do for them in their search.
It is with this background that I began my MLIS coursework.

During my studies, information seeking behaviors have been in the background, informing many of the assignments and many of the tools learned, but they have rarely been brought to the forefront.
Most of the coursework has been focused on _how_ best to help clients, with less attention paid to _why_ these strategies work.
With this in mind, I have chosen two pieces of evidence to discuss in order to show my mastery of this competency.
The first is an article review of one of the seminal works on information seeking theory, which I created for this portfolio in an attempt to better understand the background of LIS work.
The second is a series of discussion posts from one class that, while they do not discuss theory directly, do I think show my understanding of the underlying concepts and how they can be applied in practice.

###First Piece of Evidence: Article Review of Taylor (68)###

As I prepared for this portfolio, this competency gave me the most trouble in terms of selecting evidence to show my understanding and mastery.
While I was confident that I understood the relevant concepts, and that I had put them to use within my coursework, I could find little evidence that demonstrated this understanding, and almost nothing that discussed the theory behind these concepts.
I realized during my research, however, that certain common concepts were being repeated, both in the research and in my coursework that built upon this research.
Many of these concepts, such as the levels of conscious information need in a user or the common strategies for question negotiation, were derived from the work of Robert S. Taylor in the Nineteen Sixties.
So, in order to better understand the theoretical background of these concepts, as well as to explore how they can best be used for serving clients, I have reviewed Taylor's 1968 article describing these concepts from a modern perspective.

Even though it has been nearly half a century since the article was first published, many of the ideas put forth remain useful today.
The description of the four levels of articulated information need, in particular, are very important to understand for information professionals, so that we can see how the questions we are asked relate to a user's real information need, but usually do not fully encompass that need.
The filters Taylor describes that are used by reference librarians are also important to understand, if possibly incomplete, and can be recognized as the backbone of modern reference interviews.
In my own practice answering reference questions I have always tried to apply these filters, as I have seen that both the context brought by the user, much of it unconscious, must be understood in order to answer the user's question fully.
As I state in the review, Taylor's work is a good beginning to understanding user's information behavior and needs.

However, the work does have some limits that modern information professionals must go beyond.
Taylor's work marks a transition between a "system"-centered view of information science, and a "user"-centered view, and the older system-centered view is still apparent in the article.
The description of user behaviors is almost entirely in terms of how they use the available systems, with little attention paid to their thoughts and feeling within their search, or to the process that has led them to this point.
As well, librarians are assumed to be completely separate from their users, acting as gateways and guides to the information systems while almost completely leading any search in which they become involved.
More recent research shows the need to understand the _user_ just as much as their question---their thoughts and feelings that brought them to the librarian to begin with---and treats the reference interview as a collaborative relationship.
I describe how users and information professionals can partner together to find the information that the user needs, which can be far more effective than Taylor's description of an active librarian who works to understand the question and answer it, with a passive user who is lead through both processes.

Taylor was one of the first authors to codify the information needs and behaviors of library users, and many of his observations and ideas still hold up today.
It is thanks in part to his work that information professionals now understand how our users think about their own information needs, and how they question us in their attempts to fulfill those needs, and how we can and must clarify their questions in order to truly help answer their needs.
His work stands at the beginning of user-oriented information service, and is limited because of it.
Going forward, while I will keep his observations in mind, I will not keep myself apart from my users as his work assumes will happen.
My clients should be allowed and encouraged to lead the information search for themselves, with my job being to help them understand their own needs and to help connect them to the resources I have available.
There is give and take from both sides when connecting users to information, which is only possible if I understand my users better and collaborate with them as equal partners.

###Second Piece of Evidence: Advanced Reference Discussion Posts, LIBR 228###

While information seeking behavior is important for all aspects of information science, it is most apparent in the field of reference work.
During my Advanced Reference course from the Fall of 2012 information seeking was at the heart of most of the assignments, and most of the discussion.
For this piece of evidence, I have chosen selected post I made during discussion of the different challenges that face reference librarians when attempting to help patrons find the information they need.
There were several topics covered throughout the course, but they all had at their heart the need to connect users with the right information, even when they did not necessarily know what that was themselves.
Though the formal language of information seeking behaviors and theories was not brought, I believe my posts do show an understanding of these concepts, and how they can be used to better help my clientele.

They very first week addressed a question of service, and how to be most effective in connecting users with information.
We discussed the idea of having "personal" librarians, librarians who directly contact patrons and work with them one-on-one rather than wait for them to come to the desk and ask for help.
I found this appealing, if probably difficult to implement within a public library, and compared it to my experiences in retail between stationary cashiers and customer service associates who actively roam a sales floor seeking out customers who need help.
In both contexts, customers and clients are more likely to find what they need, and be satisfied with the service they have received, if we come to them early rather than wait for them to come to us.

From a theoretical standpoint, this is simply taking the common reference behavior described by @Taylor_question68 to the next logical level.
The reference interview, which he describes as question negotiation, is largely spent trying to get the user to step back from the often too-detailed and specific "compromised" question back to the real information need that led to that point.
By approaching patrons earlier and more often, before they come to us for help, we can short-circuit this chain of events and discover the information need before it has been compromised by the user's failed attempts.
If we are proactive in discovering our users' information needs before they come to us for help, we are more likely to get at the real question with much less time spent negotiating our way past the false starts and wrong turns that usually characterize a complex reference interview.
Our users will see that we care about their needs sooner, they will find the information they need quicker, and they will be much more satisfied with their overall experience.

Later in the course, during week 5, we began discussing strategies for helping users who are researching controversial topics, in this case religion.
Helping to research religious topics presents many different problems, from the purely technical to the very personal.
An important part of the reference interview, then, is to discover in detail what the user needs, and to not make any assumptions based on our own knowledge or beliefs.
Again, the user may not know exactly what they are looking for, or how that related to what is available, and is looking to the librarian as a guide to muddle through the confusion.
On the other hand, the user will have his or her own beliefs that relate to their research, and they certainly do not want a librarian to preach something different instead of helping to answer their questions, nor would they want a librarian to avoid the right information simply because they did not agree with the interpretation.

As a first line, this connects back to @Taylor_question68 again and his description of the filters that reference librarians use, in that it is vitally important to establish the objective of the query and the background assumptions and context brought by the user.
If we understand the objective and purpose of the question, we can avoid materials that are inappropriate to the question, which is all too easy to do if we assume too much about any particular field.
If we make sure to clarify the user's background and the context of the question, as well, we can avoid offending them with materials of conflicting beliefs, or especially unconsciously offering materials that too closely match our _own_ beliefs.
More subtle than this, though, and in my opinion just as important, is to avoid _leading_ the user too far in any direction.
We should keep with the suggestions of @Lundh_studying10 by making the search a collaborative effort.
If we act as partners with our clients in their search for information, that will be much better able to direct the search toward what they really want or need, while if we try to lead them too directly we may taint the search with what we _think_ they should want or need.

This question of leading (or not) came up again from a different angle the following week, with the question of whether and how librarians should use reference questions to teach their patrons how to use library systems, rather than simply answering their questions.
The answer I advocate is that it depends a great deal on the type of question, and the patience of the user.
Some clients would be eager and grateful to learn how to better find information on their own, as they often feel embarrassed or as if they are wasting the librarian's time if they have to ask for very much.
On the other hand, many patrons simply want a quick and simple answer, and would be too impatient to endure a lecture on how they could have found the answer themselves.
I think the librarian should do their best to keep aware of where the client sits on the Information Search Process [@Kuhlthau_seeking04], and bear in mind that at some stages clients are frustrated by the information they have found and simply want an answer to put the search behind them, while at other they are excited and optimistic and may be more open to strategies for finding even more.

There are also several more or less effective strategies for instructing reference users that could be used, and it is important to try to determine the client's learning style if instruction is going to be attempted.
I mention in the post n article that connects reference questions with Bloom's taxonomy of learning objective as a way to guide the reference interview and the level of instruction involved.
I should also have connected it to the information seeking characteristics, identified by @EH_modelling97, as a guide for possible types of instruction.
These characteristics describe different ways that users search for information, including "chaining" from one resource to the next, "browsing" in a non-directed way, and "extracting" the relevant information from a resource.
This could be used as a basis for different strategies for finding information, based on the searching and learning style of the client him- or herself.

In later weeks, which focused on the specific challenges related to specific areas of study, I came to see that there are other factors that affect information seeking than just where on a particular lines or graph a user may lie.
I partially saw this with the discussion on religious research, but it became even more prominent later when we discussed the research of Art.
Art, like several other subjects, is a fast moving target with constantly changing ideas about what is even included in the field for research.
As well, every user brings their own opinions about what should be considered Art, and what should not.
It is here when I began to internalize what is suggested by Wilson's model of human information behavior [-@Wilson_human00].
This model not only shows several different stages of information seeking, but also shows that these stages are further affected by the seekers background, age, demographics, and connection to the information.
In order to help users find the information they need, we need to understand how they are connected to that information and what they consider to be a part of the information space to begin with.

Again, in the discussions themselves I did not use the direct language or cite the formal theories of information seeking behavior.
However, I have understood the concepts behind these theories, and how they can be used to better serve my clients.
I have internalized that patrons come from a variety of different backgrounds that affect how they search for information, as well as when they will eventually seek help in finding it.
I have seen for myself that the questions asked by users are rarely the ones they need answered, and how to negotiate that question back to the read information need, as well as how approaching clients sooner rather than later can help to clarify their questions even sooner.
I know how to partner with people to help them discover the best way for _them_ to find the information they need, though I can also recognize when I should simply answer the question to the best of my ability and be done with it.
I continue to use all of these strategies to develop the best service techniques that I can use for my clients.

##Future Application##

Going forward, I will always do my best to understand my users and their questions, not only what information they are trying to find, but also how they connect to that information and how they got to the point where they came to me for assistance.
This will not only improve these relationships in general, it will also allow me to more fully understand their information needs, and to connect them with better, more accurate, and more relevant information in order to fulfill these needs.
Since I understand how users search for information, I can understand what processes they have already tried, and the frustration and roadblocks they must have encountered before they asked for help.
I can not only help them find what they need, then, I can also show them additional strategies and techniques that will help them search for information the next time that they need to do so.
Every search is then improved, whether I am directly involved or not, and every user will be better served by the information systems available.
