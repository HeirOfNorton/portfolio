##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

We live in an increasingly computerized world, and nowhere is that more obvious than in the field of Library and Information Science.
Virtually every library now uses a computer database for its catalog, most have full or partial access to journal and article databases, and many patrons use libraries primarily for access to the internet.
While the earliest information retrieval systems were in print, such as card catalogs and article listings like the original MLA Bibliography, now nearly all are online and digitized, with systems and languages all their own to index, list, and search the materials they contain or access.
To be successful today, LIS professionals must be able to design and create such systems so that their contents can be retrieved, must be able to browse and search such systems in order to access their contents for patrons, and must be able to compare and critique such systems in order to choose the right system among multiple options.


##Preparation and Evidence##

In a way I have been preparing for this competency for most of my life, though I was unaware of it.
I began using my local library's Online Public Access Catalog and learning the best ways to search it before my family owned a computer, and before the world wide web even existed.
When the internet became widespread, I quickly started learning the best ways to find the web sites I wanted, including the boolean queries needed to make the most of early search engines like Altavista and Lycos.
When I began to learn the formal elements of information retrieval systems in my MLIS classes, I took to them immediately.

I have chosen three pieces of evidence to demonstrate my preparation for and mastery of this competency.
The first is a design document for a database created to have the most useful and relevant information for a target audience, while being easily searchable.
The second is a report comparing and evaluating the design and usability of two OPACs of nearby and related library systems.
The third is a learning tool created to help teach young students and beginners how to query and search online article databases.


###First Piece of Evidence: Database of Supreme Court Justices, LIBR 202###

One of the first courses I took in the MLIS program, in the Fall of 2011, was a course specifically introducing information retrieval systems.
One of the main projects for this course was the design of a database, including the limits of all the different variable fields and a justification for each, aimed at a specific target audience.
The preliminary groundwork for the design, such as the specific information to be saved and the target audience chosen, was taken from group projects earlier in the semester, but the design itself was created individually.
I chose this project because it shows several of the different aspects involved in the creation of an information retrieval system.

This database was created with a specific audience in mind, in this case for hypothetical history students taking an advanced undergraduate course on historical demographics.
Intended audience has a great effect on the information contained in an information retrieval system, including the items used for indexing and searching.
While this is a database of U.S. Supreme Court justices, the information included would be different than if the database was intended for student of law or politics.
The database design focuses on information of interest to history and demographics students, such as birth and nomination dates, race, and sex, while only having passing mention of fields that would be the focus for other students, such as political affiliation and major court decisions.
Ideally, a database such as this in the real world would include a great deal more information, and would likely therefor be useful to any students studying the Supreme Court, but of course an assignment for class must be limited.
Even so, databases are rarely created for all audiences and often cannot afford to try to be everything for all users.
The choices I made limiting the data show that I can adapt as necessary in these situations.

This project also introduced me to how the specific data allowed in a database can and must be limited within the design in order to be practical for the database software.
This is similar in principle to Authority control in library catalog records, which allow multiple records describing to same thing or person to stay consistent with one another [@Vellucci_metadata00].
A database made up of unstructured text is almost impossible to search or to keep consistent.
Wherever possible, I mandated that text fields be validated against a formal vocabulary, in this case the names of the justice and their nominating president against the Library of Congress Name Authority records.
Some fields are even further limited to a specific list of values, such as the field for the justice's identified race.
I do mention that some fields, such as the listing of major case decisions, could benefit from a controlled vocabulary in a database intended for a wider audience, but that it is unnecessary in this database for an audience that is not focussed on law or politics.
I learned with this project that, paradoxically, it is often best to limit the information in a database as much as possible to keep it useful.

While I had a great deal of informal experience using information retrieval systems, this was my first introduction to the formal design of them.
I felt limited by the software used, but also found that limits on the data are needed and desired for a good database design.
I now see the need for limited vocabularies to keep the data consistent, and how to tailor the variables included so that the information included can be used in different situations like simple searches of single record, or more complex searches for statistical analysis. 
As I move forward in my career, I am sure that I will have ample need and opportunity to create other databases, whether for limited audiences like this or broader designs for larger groups of users.
The next step, I believe, is to learn the more technical side of database creation, such as SQL for queries and the more complex requirements of relational databases.


###Second Piece of Evidence: Comparison of two OPACs, LIBR 202###

The introduction to Information Systems class was not limited to just databases, of course, nor to only the design side of these systems.
A later project was to evaluate and compare two library Online Catalogs.
In particular, I analyzed their usability and intuitiveness for searching and browsing, not just for myself but also for several different users with little or no formal training in catalog searching.
I enlisted some friends and members of my family for this evaluation, in the hope that they could see limits and difficulties of the systems compared that I might miss as a LIS student.
I chose the library systems of two neighboring counties, so that I was comparing apples to apples, and attempted to create a list of items to search for that would allow a thorough and accurate picture of the strengths and weaknesses of both systems.

I found that, despite how close the two library systems are to each other, their catalog systems were quite different.
One, Ramsey County, used a current licensed ILS with several modern features to make it conform to more common "Web 2.0" standards.
The other, Anoka County, still had an older system in place that was less intuitive and more technical, though in some ways easier to specify exactly what is needed.
Both had a great deal of information available for each item in the catalog, most of it copied from OCLC records but supplemented by information from other book listings and review aggregators, so that users could decide whether or not the items were right for them.
The presentation was also different, with Anoka County listing things in a more formal and regimented format, and Ramsey County listing items in less formal way reminiscent of online book stores like Amazon.
I found the Ramsey County OPAC to be more complete, allowing access and searching to much more of the relevant metadata, but I was frustrated that I could not specify how and which metadata to search in detail.

In this case, getting the outside opinions of my friends and family showed with certainty how important it is to get feedback from the primary intended audience, instead of relying on my own observations.
As @Emanuel_next09 discovered, what users want and expect from a catalog is often different from what LIS professionals want.
While I was frustrated by Ramsey County's inability to specify the data fields to search, users without my LIS training felt no such limitation and found the search very intuitive, but were confused by Anoka County's rigid adherence to metadata fields.
They put much higher value in some of the added on features of the Ramsey County OPAC, such as the display of book covers and outside reviews, and the ability of library users to tag and review the items for themselves.
Though we reached the same conclusion---that Ramsey County had the overall superior system---our reasons for that conclusion were quite different.

With this project, I discovered that what I want and expect out of an information retrieval system will often not be what is wanted by the average user.
I saw clearly that any evaluation of an information retrieval system must keep the target audience in mind, and that with my formal education in LIS systems, I am often not the target audience.
Evaluation, then, should include the target audience if possible, either taking into account their own experiences with the system, or at least what they want from the system as a set of criteria to watch for.
When I have to judge information systems in the future, I will always keep this in mind, and not rely only on my own experiences with them.

###Third Piece of Evidence: Database Research Pathfinder, LIBR 210###

My final piece of evidence for this competency comes from a course on Reference Services I took in the Spring of 2012.
One large project for that course was a blog I helped to create as part of a group that had several pages of instruction and resources aimed at a teenage audience for researching and writing school papers and essays.
One of the pages that I wrote for this blog is a guide to conducting research using online article databases, including how to query such a database.
Again, this was intended for an audience of teens, so the language was kept informal and no assumptions are made about the knowledge or needs of the reader, except that they need to research something for class.
I approached it with the possibility that the user may have never used a database before at all, and so would need a crash course in how they are used.

Aside from an introduction on what academic research is and why it is needed for formal school papers, I began by taking the reader through choosing a database to use.
After all, different databases are used for different purposes, and it would be a waste of time to search through the wrong database for the chosen topic.
I describe how to narrow down the topic, and how to determine which databases are available to the user via their school or library, before choosing a single database to search from that criteria.
It had not really occurred to me consciously before this project, but I realized that the first step in querying a database is knowing what that database covers, and whether or not it is right for the research in question.
Most databases are not catch-all resources that list everything under the sun, but are instead limited and specific, the better to focus on a topic in detail.

I do, of course, follow this with a description of how to query a single database.
I describe the describe the different fields that can be searched in order to narrow and specify what to find, though different databases may have slightly different fields available.
I give a brief lesson on Boolean operators, again so that searches can be made more specific, in order to avoid the common situation of retrieving an overwhelming number of articles, more than could ever be read or used.
I complete this part of the lesson with the often necessary specifiers to narrow the search to Peer Reviewed articles that are available in the database as Full Text.
I drew upon my own experiences using databases for research as an undergraduate student in order to teach the aspects of searching that are most relevant and useful to someone writing an essay.

I have found that often the best way to learn or demonstrate a topic is to teach it, and this section shows for this competency my knowledge of database querying skills.
I learned, however, that querying information systems goes beyond the formal search language, and indeed starts much earlier with the choice of information system to use in the first place.
Searches must be adapted to fit the topic, coverage, and specific language used by the database to be searched, and so searching a database requires researching that database.
Going forward, I can keep this principle in mind when helping users find information for themselves, helping them to choose the correct information system before helping them to search that system for the specific information they need.

##Future Application##

As I already stated, information retrieval systems are at the heart of nearly every aspect of Library and Information systems in the modern world.
They cannot be avoided, and so they must be learned.
Each system is different, with its own quirks and limitations, but the broad principles remain the same.
Each has a specific area of focus, which may be very broad or very narrow, and that focus depends on the intended users of the system, so these users must be kept in mind.
In my career, I will strive to connect users to the information systems that best fit their information needs and interests, whether that be to show them a single specific database with detailed information on their topic, or a broad conglomeration that will allow them to search a wide range of sources for what they need.
Databases are for users, after all, and are only useful to the extent that a user can find what they need within it.
