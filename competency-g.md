##Meaning and Articulation of Competency##

There is more information available in even a single library than any one person would ever be able to know.
Librarians and information professionals need to make all of the information available to them manageable, so that they can connect their users to the information and resources they need.
Cataloging and classification are the most common terms for this process, which in essence means to describe resources in brief so that users can discover the information they contain without having to read them, and organizing the resources available so that specific items can be found easily.
Over time, several agreed-upon standards for these tasks have been developed so that different libraries and organizations can reuse one another's work, and so that new systems do not need to be learned when moving from one institution to another.

##Preparation and Evidence##

In library and information science today, any discussion of organization, cataloging, and classification ends up being a discussion of metadata.
Metadata is information _about_ information.
It is used to describe a resource so that users can determine what the resource is, what it contains, and how to find it, all without needing to have the resource itself in front of them.
There are many different kinds of metadata, and many different standards, with different purposes that may complement one another or compete with each other for acceptance.

The most comprehensive types of metadata, and some of the oldest standards created, are used to describe a resource as thoroughly as possible.
These records about resources are generally collected in a catalog, so that users can search for resources in a more systematic manner than simply browsing stacks of books.
The standards describe not only what information about a resource can be included, but what _must_ be included, and how to format the information for consistency.
The most important such standard used in library settings right now are the Anglo-American Catalog Rules, second edition, or the AACR2.
This standard has very detailed rules and guidelines for the metadata that can and must be used to describe nearly any kind of information resource.
A more recent standard, Resource Description and Access, is intended to replace AACR2, and it has updated rules to take account of the greater amount of electronic resources that exist today than when AACR2 was created.

While cataloging resources, many institutions are particularly concerned with _access points_, metadata that can be used to search and find a resource.
The most common access points are the author or creator of a resource, and its name or title.
Another type of access point, useful if the user does not have a single specific resource in mind, is a list of any subject headings, used to describe what a resource is _about_ rather than simply what it _is_.
Standard authorized lists have been created for all of these access points to ensure _consistency_, so that different metadata will describe the same thing in the same way, and _uniqueness_, so that metadata will always describe different things in different ways.
The most commonly used of these are the Library of Congress Authority Records, listing names of people and organizations, and the Library of Congress Subject Headings, listing subjects and topics with rules for creating new headings as needed, though there are other lists for smaller or more specialized libraries.

Cataloging using the above standards tries to describe resources thoroughly on its own.
The other main type of metadata, classification, tries to organize resources in relation to one another,
With classification, every resource has precisely one description, usually created based on the most important subject or topic of the resource.
One of the oldest and most important standards for classification is the Dewey Decimal Classification system, though it has been replaced in many libraries by the Library of Congress Classification system.
These schemes are both designed so that, if the classified resources are arranged in order, related resources on the same topic will always be next to one another, and indeed nearly all libraries arrange their collections to follow the classification scheme that they have adopted.

No discussion of metadata standards would be complete without mentioning the ways of storing and presenting that metadata.
Library metadata was for decades stored as text on catalog cards, so one of the first standards to be created that is still in use is the International Standard for Bibliographic Description, which describes the order to present metadata and how to punctuate it to be readable.
Library computer systems will nearly always have metadata encoded in MAchine Readable Cataloging, or MARC, format.
XML, a method of tagging plain text to make it machine readable, is used as a basis for many newer metadata standards, such as MARCXML and MODS, both intended to possibly replace MARC, and EAD, used for archival finding aids.
None of these standards stand alone, and many complement one another.
For example, MARC records nearly always follow the ISBD and AACR2 (and more recently RDA) standards, and they have specific fields for Dewey or LoC classification numbers.

I began my MLIS with little knowledge of these many standards, save for my experiences searching for books using their classification numbers.
I have since learned a great deal about these standards and the purposes behind them, though it could take years to truly master even a single full standard.
To show my growth and how I have integrated my knowledge of these principles, I have chosen four pieces of evidence.
The first two, considered together, are exercises in which I had to create catalog records for different kinds of items, with the second piece of evidence a separate project in which I cataloged a human being.
The third piece of evidence is a report I wrote describing the approach taken by a local library for the cataloging and classification of non-book items in its collection.
The fourth piece of evidence is an archival finding aid I created, which also required me to organize the items involved.

###First and Second Pieces of Evidence: Cataloging Exercises and Cataloging a Human, LIBR 248###

Most of the work I have done to learn metadata standards was during a Cataloging and Classification class I took during Fall semester of 2012.
During the course we periodically had exercises in which we had to catalog an item from a photocopy of its title page (or equivalent for non-book items), in a text equivalent of MARC format and following the current version of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules.
At the end of the course this culminated in a project to catalog a human being as fully as possible using the same standards.
This also required the use of other standards for classification numbers and subject headings, which must be applied creatively to work for a living person.
I chose to catalog my niece for this project.

Both MARC format and the AACR2 standard can be very demanding, which was the main challenge for these assignments.
Both AACR2 and MARC have multiple levels of cataloging for records, each requiring different amounts of information [@OCLC_online13], and the Human cataloging project in particular required full cataloging.
As well, the MARC records needed to be present very exactly, with the correct punctuation in all sections and the correct codes and labels on every line.
In practice, any cataloging using these standards would need either specialized software or a copy of the standards within reach for constant reference, probably both.

This experience cataloging my niece helped to show me that the standards used in library cataloging and classification can really be applied to almost anything, not just the books and other obvious media for which they were originally designed.
I had to show my understanding of this while deciding on the various metadata included in the record I created for her.
I had to create an appropriate description, both physical and abstract, to properly document my niece while complying with AACR2 level three requirements.
I also needed to choose appropriate subject headings from the Library of Congress Subject Headings authority, which I used to describe her personal background and her present personality.
I did have some fun when it came to the section on reproduction rights, though.
Still, I took standards that are typically used for easily identifiable media and successfully used them to document something that is unlikely to ever be included in a library collection.

Throughout these assignments, I became more familiar not only with the most common cataloging standards currently used, but also the challenges that come from trying to apply them.
The purpose of cataloging in this fashion is to make the resources described more available to a library's users, and as such enough detail needs to be included, in the correct way, to make the catalog record worthwhile.
I can apply the AACR2 requirements to books, DVDs and videos, and now after applying them to a human, I am confident I can apply them to nearly anything.
I have always believed that one should learn to work out the math before using a calculator.
While most catalog records are entered using specialized software, I know the base "math" beneath them to understand what is being entered and why.

###Third Piece of Evidence: Report on Non-Book Cataloging, LIBR 248###

The cataloging and classification course I took was concerned not only with the ideal standards of organization, but also the challenges faced in practice.
For another project, I went to a library and observed for myself how it organized all of its non-books items, which are often more difficult to process and offer to patrons than books.
I chose the Roseville, MN branch of the Ramsey County library system, one of the larger libraries in my area.
I took information for the library's web site and catalog, I inspected the physical collection, and I spoke to the library's Technical Services Manager, all to form a more complete picture of how non-book items are handled.
I found several ways in which standards are difficult to follow, and in which the common standards along are not enough to make the materials accessible for users.

The main non-book items held by the library are other kinds of media, including DVDs, audio recordings on CD, and video games.
It also holds a couple specialty items such power check meters used to test power output of appliances in the home.
All non-book items are fully cataloged, most using copy cataloging from multiple sources.
However, as noted by @Mason_copy12, it is often impossible to find a perfect catalog record to copy.
Different sources are required as very few sources include all needed information to form a complete catalog record to the standards used by the library.
These records conform, in the end, to AACR2 level two or higher cataloging for all items.

A greater challenge for users of the library comes from the classification system used, and from that the call numbers created for the non-book collection.
The library as a whole uses Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) for non-fiction items, and an abbreviation of the author's name or title for fiction and other items, but this system proves inadequate for the non-book collection.
Fiction DVDs and audio books, in particular, have no full classification, and the abbreviations used for the call number create a lot of overlap, making it difficult to distinguish different items from the call number alone, and the video games are even worse about this.
Music CDs do use DDC call numbers, but this proves useless for finding an item as nearly everything falls within the same number.
A more specialized classification standard, like the ANSCR classification for music, would make it much easier for users to find specific items.
In this case, even though a standard is used, it is not enough for the purpose since it is not specific enough to the format.

Related to the problems with classification, and more immediately visible to users, are the problems with physically organizing the non-book materials on the shelves.
The classification and call numbers are mainly used to locate items within the collection, but because of the way these items are physically organized at the Roseville library, it can be very difficult to find anything specific even with the call number.
The whole purpose of organizing library materials and assigning standard classification numbers is to make those items easier to find and use, a purpose which is not upheld at this library.
I found these items physically arranged in such a way, face out instead of spine out but still packed together several to a shelf bin, that the call number are often difficult to see, and all but impossible to arrange in proper order.
As I reported, the single greatest improvement the library could make to its collection may simply be to reshelve it so that users can see what is available.

I learned through this project that standards are not always applied equally in "the field", and that even if they are applied it is sometimes not enough to allow users to find the items they need.
In particular, I learned that, in certain contexts, using the common classification standards is not the best way to arrange library materials so that they can be found.
Fiction is better sorted by author name, reflecting how people are used to browsing and searching, and some areas may need to use a specialty classification standard simply to make classification useful at all.
As I go forward in my career, I will be sure to check how library materials are shelved and presented, as even the best classification standard are useless if users cannot read or locate the number on the shelf.

###Fourth Piece of Evidence: Finding Aid Project, LIBR 256###

My last piece of evidence for this competency was created for an introductory class on Archives and Manuscripts that I took in the Summer of 2013.
I created a finding aid for a collection of archival paper, which first required me to organize and arrange those papers in a logical fashion.
While regular library materials typically are cataloged in their entirety, for archival records this is nearly impossible due to the enormous amount of material to be sorted and preserved, often in loose papers with little obvious to connect one to another.
To create the finding aid, I had to choose a method of arranging the papers, decide how to deal with different kinds of papers, and describe the different groupings and how they relate to each other.

Ideally, papers such as these would be digitized and indexed so they could be searched.
This, however, if often ipossible, or at least prohibitively expensive, as described by @Kastellec_practical12, so I concentrated on sorting the papers as they are.
I chose to arrange the papers in a hierarchy based first on the type of papers being collected.
A user conducting research using this collection, I felt, would likely need only one kind, and if not would still appreciate being able to distinguish between them ahead of time.
I gathered the letters together, separate from official government and work records, which were also separate from other papers that appeared to be of more sentimental value.
I further separated the letters by the author, and finally arranged them by date written, if it could be determined.

The finding aid itself required learning yet another metadata standard, in this case General International Standard Archival Description, or ISAD(G), used for determining what information should be included in an archival finding aid, and how to arrange it.
I did my best to follow this standard with the limited information available to me, though in practice I would use additional outside sources in order to fill in some of the gaps left by the materials themselves.
Many finding aids of this type are now commonly encode in EAD, an XML format that allows for finding aids to be shared and searched by multiple different institutions.
Archival materials and their finding aids are also sometimes cataloged in a MARC record by the library that maintains the archive.
For this assignment, however, I did not have a need or the time to translate the record into either of these formats.

This assignment gave me valuable experience directly organizing materials so that will be useful for researchers.
I was able to take a random pile of papers and make a structure and hierarchy out of the constituent parts, and then create a standards compliant finding aid to give access to these materials.
In this context, the act of cataloging is more important than ever, but also very messy, and I had to use careful judgement about what to describe and what to leave for researchers to discover themselves.
This is a very different experience from cataloging regular library materials, and serves as a contrast with the work needed to catalog a book or video for a general user.

##Future Application##

I have seen several different sides of how information is organized, with different aspects being emphasized depending on the context, the type of information, and the intended user of the information.
Metadata standards can be applied at the bare minimum, or very thoroughly, and sometimes there is no standard to regulate the information that must be gathered and cataloged.
These standards, especially computer file formats, are often changing, and with more competing or complementary standards being added all the time.
It is impossible to memorize all of them and be able to perfectly utilize them at all times.
Now, though, I have a solid background of the reasons behind the standards, and the tools to research and apply whichever standards are most appropriate for the context in which I may find myself working.
