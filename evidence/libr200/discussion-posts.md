##Week 2 Discussion Post - Ethical Dilemmas##

As information becomes easier to access, and easier to track, the overriding ethical dilemma for those in information science is becomming the questions of who should be allowed access, and who should be allowed to know about it. One major concern is that of copyright infringement. Rubin describes how more and more information is becomming available on the internet (2010, p. 1). This makes everything easier to access, including many things that the creators of the information do not want to be so easy to get. This extends from the obvious cases of music and movie piracy, to the more subtle problems of students photocopying articles and companies creating invasive Digital Rights Management software.

A more fundamental issue for many people comes from the changing ideas about privacy and national security. The USA PATRIOT act gives the U.S. government far greater access to patrons' personal information than ever before. Some librarians fight back as best they can, such as those in Vermont described by Penenberg who sidestep the law to keep their patrons informed (2004). However, as Rubin mentions, many younger people in the digital age are less converned with personal privacy as they are more accustomed to posting much of this information themselves on public websites (p. 4). Going forward, librarians will need to know what the law says they may do and must do, but will also need to understand their patrons to know how best to respond to the changing world.

##Week 6 Discussion Post - Library Profile##

The Roseville Public Library, located in Roseville, Minnesota, is the largest branch of the Ramsey County Library system. According to the Ramsey County Library website (2011), the Roseville branch was first built in 1964 to serve as the headquarters of the system. It was remodeled in 1981, rebuilt in 1993, and remodeled again in 2010. The newest version of the building is large and modern, with an open floor featuring islands of new books and recommendations from the staff, halls leading to the Children and Teen sections, and a large staircase in the center leading to the adult fiction and non-fiction on the second floor. There are large banks of computers, as well as wifi access throughout the building. Large collections of DVDs and audio books also dominate the central floor, and a coffee shop is connected as a wing to cater to the tastes of their patrons.

I met with the Library Branch Manager, Bill Michel (2011), to discuss the library and the direction it is going. Mr. Michel has been manager for four years, but has been working in the Ramsey County Libraries for thrity-six years, starting while he was still a student on a temporary assignment. He informed me that the Rosevile library serves as a backup depository for not only the Ramsey County library system, but also the eight other county library systems that serve the Twin Cities. The Roseville branch primarily serves a population of about 75,000 people, but in practice it can serve as many as 250,000 in its role as central hub.

With that large a user base, Mr. Michel told me that his library's biggest challenge by far is inadequate staffing. The Roseville library employs about 35-40 people, though fewer than half that number are full time, and also has about 80 volunteers at any given time. This is barely two thirds of the average staffing level of other comparable libraries in the Twin Cities, and still less than the estimated number needed to serve the community to their fullest ability. Ramsey County has been "really lean" as he said, and while they have not had any layoffs, they are also not filling vacancies as they open due to people retiring or otherwise moving on.

Even with the low staff, the Rosevile library has a number of programs to serve their community of which Mr. Michel is proud. For the last five years they have offered information literacy classes of all levels, ranging from beginning computer use to Health Services and eBook use. They also colaborate with the Metro Library Service Agency, or MeLSA, to offer Jobseeker classes, and have begun cooperating with the Science Museum of Minnesota to offer classes there as well. Looking forward, they plan to stay proactive in providing new and better services to their patrons, and specifically are trying to strengthen their Children's and Teen's services while deemphasizing their desk services. They remain a primary source of information and entertainment for their community.

##Week 9 Discussion Post - PATRIOT Act##

There is a great deal of controversy regarding the balance between privacy and security in libraries. On the one hand, library patrons expect that their reading habits should not be collected or used against them, and most librarians and the ALA agree with them, but on the other hand many terrorists have used library services to further their agendas, and this information could be used to catch them and save lives. Rosenbaum (2001) describes an event immediately after 9/11, in which a librarian, Kathleen Hensman, reported one of her patrons to the police when she saw that he was suspected of terrorism. I am for open government, and oppose many of the powers and restrictions created by the USA PATRIOT act. In this case, however, I believe that Hensman acted correctly, and that her actions do not undermine a desire for greated privacy and openness in government investigation.

The argument hinges on what constitutes privacy, the right to privacy. The Fourth Ammendment of the U.S. constitution limits the ability of the goverment to sieze evidence while investigating a crime, in particular requiring probable cause and for te person being investigated to be informed of that cause. The broad powers of the USA PATRIOT act violates those restrictions, in my opinion. Essex (2004) describes the serious questions of privacy and due process that surround this part of the act. Rubin (2010) describes the changes that have been made to the act in 2006, which make it a bit better. It now has stricter requirements for probable cause, preventing this power from being used for "fishing expeditions," and to this extent I do support the act and how it allows investigation of library records as long as proper procedure is still followed. Where I must draw the line, and where I think the act is still in violation of the constitution, is in the matter of disclosure. Libraries are still not allowed to inform their patrons that any investigation is occurring, and this makes oversight nearly impossible, as well as there being no opportunity for patrons to defend themselves. As well, Jaeger et al (2004) describe how this makes any research on the impact and use of the act nearly impossible.

Hensman, however, faced a different dilemma, in my opinion. This was not a matter of protecting her patrons from overreaching investigations that may or may not have anything to do with a crime. In her case, the crime was known and had already been committed. When she called police, it was to report the activities of a known suspect for specific actions. She was not allowing the government to invade her library because of suspicious behavior, but rather leading the police to specific persons for specific reasons, unrelated to their reading habits. The right to privacy does not make a patron invisible, but rather is only to protect them from unwarranted persecution. Hensman, as she was described in Rosenbaum's (2001) article, was a witness to the activities and locations of suspected terrorists. Any other user of the library could have reported the same information, and if they were aware of it almost certainly would have. This does not undermine the need for better protection on the privacy of library patrons in general, it simply shows that librarians should not feel hamstrung by policy when genuine evidence of a crime is in front of them.

###Week 11 Discussion Post - Privelege in Libraries###

On the whole, I agree with the conclusion that Austin (2004) reached in that the relationship between librarian and patron is not privileged and cannot be so at this time. While librarians are certainly professionals, often with a great deal of education and research behind them, that background is too loosely defined and inconsistent from one librarian to the next, and there is too little formal oversight, for privilege to be realistic. This on top of the fact that most interactions are very much in public, where there would be no expectation of privilege to begin with. There is more to privilege than simply keeping one's mouth shut, and at this point it is too much to ask of most librarians.

The relationship between librarian and patron should certainly be private, however. Privilege is not simply privacy; rather it means that the service provider cannot be compelled to give that privacy under any circumstances. It began as an extension of the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution which prevents anyone from being forced to incriminate themselves, recognizing that such protection must extend to conversations with doctors, spouses, and lawyers as well. While libraries do not have the same expectation of privilege, they do have an expectation of privacy. As Rubin (2010) describes, the protection of patrons' privacy is a central part of nearly every code of ethics and behavior yet created for librarians. Librarians should protect their patrons' privacy as much as legally possible, but they may still be compelled to divulge that information under court order.

So privilege is not expected or really possible at this time, but going along with Austin (2004) I would support it becoming so with some changes to the current way of doing things. First of all, there must be both training, agreement, and oversight. Doctors, lawyers, and priests do not just have codes of ethics, but they take solemn oaths to never break privilege, with severe consequences if they ever do. If we are to have privileged librarians, they must have the same dedication, along with an oath, and equally severe consequences if that oath if ever broken. They must also have protection in the law. It is only privilege, instead of privacy, if they legally cannot be coerced into revealing their patrons' information. I honestly would not expect these changes to happen anytime soon, but I think there is a need that could be fulfilled if they were. People should have the right to find the information they need, regardless of the source, without fear of reprisal or incrimination for that knowledge. We simply do not have the legal infrastructure to make that possible right now.
