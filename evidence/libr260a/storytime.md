##Overview of the Library

The Ramsey County Library system is situated in north Saint Paul,
Minnesota, as well as Roseville and the surrounding suburbs. It has
eight branch locations and serves over 250,00 people. The Roseville
branch is the largest library in the system. Renovated in 2010, it holds
over 340,000 items and includes a community room that can sit up to 125
people, where its storytimes are held ("Ramsey County Libraries" 2011).
According to the library's branch manager Bill Michel, the Roseville
branch serves as a hub and repository for the entire Ramsey County
Library system, as well as the eight other library systems serving the
Twin Cities (personal communication, Sep. 28, 2011). While it primarily
serves a local population of about 75,000 people, in practice it can
serve as many as 250,000 people in its role as a central hub.

##Demographics

The Roseville branch is located in Roseville, MN, a large suburb in the
Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area. According to 2010 census data,
Roseville has a total population of 33,660 ("City of Roseville", 2012).
The population of Roseville is made up of 83.7% Caucasian, 7.3% African
American, and 8.2% Asian, with 4.6% identifying as Hispanic or Latino.
23.2% of households have children under 18 years old, and 10.3% of the
total population is 9 years old or younger. Library patronage would
follow these statistics.

##Storytime plan

The library offers three different types of storytimes for different age
groups. "Baby & Me" storytimes are offered every other Wednesday at
9:45am. "Toddler" storytimes are offered every other Tuesday at noon.
Finally, every Thursday evening at 6pm they have "Family" storytimes, in
which all ages are welcome, though the focus is on ages 0-8. The
"Family" storytimes are offered in the evening when older children will
be out of school and most parents will be off from work, while the
younger storytimes come earlier in the day when older children will
still be in school, to allow greater flexibility for parents to bring
their children when it is best for them.

This month, all storytimes will have a theme of "Our Amazing World."
Using appropriate books and songs, we will explore the many wondrous
things that can be found in the world outside our homes, including
animals, natural places, plants, and the sky above us. Week 1 will have
"Baby & Me" and "Family" storytimes that feature different kinds of
animals. Week 2 will have "Toddler" and "Family" storytimes focusing on
places found in nature. Week 3 will have "Baby & Me" and "Family"
storytimes about different kinds of plants. Week 4 will have "Toddler"
and "Family" storytimes about the sky.

The "Baby & Me" storytimes, a lapsit program for children up to age two,
are held in the morning. According to Peck (2006), mornings are best for
this age group, possibly even before the library opens, because babies
are most likely to be awake and active at this time without being
cranky. The "Toddler" storytimes are held later in the morning to give
children time to get back home for lunch or a nap. The "Family"
storytimes are held in the evening so that working parents have a better
chance of being able to bring their children, and to accommodate
children in school during the day.

The "Baby & Me" storytimes emphasize repetition, rhythm, and songs to
keep the children's interest, and are kept brief with playtime and board
books available at the end. The "Toddler" storytimes have a bit more
variation, with more interactivity to hold the older kids' attention,
and sometimes with a small craft to do at the end. The "Family"
storytimes also have craft projects at the end, and they have more
narrative and complex books and songs. The different storytimes will
typically last 25 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes, respectively, but
will always have the complete hour blocked out to allow for playtime and
crafts.

Every storytime begins and ends with the same songs, to keep continuity
and familiarity among the children. Each session also starts with a
brief announcement introducing that week's theme, and ends with an
announcement regarding the library's upcoming activities. The children's
librarian will remain available to answer any questions from the
children or their parents, and age-appropriate books will be brought out
for children to read or check out.

###Elephants Out to Play

One Elephant went out to play  
Upon a spider's web one day;  
He had such tremendous fun  
That he called for another Elephant to come!

Two Elephants went out to play  
Upon a spider's web one day;  
They had such tremendous fun  
That they called for another Elephant to come!

Three Elephants went out to play  
Upon a spider's web one day;  
They had such tremendous fun  
That they called for another Elephant to come!

Four Elephants went out to play  
Upon a spider's web one day;  
They had such tremendous fun  
That they called for another Elephant to come!

Five Elephants went out to play  
Upon a spider's web one day;  
They had such tremendous fun  
That they all had a picnic in the sun!

###Five Little Ducks

Went out one day  
Over the hill and far away  
Mother duck said  
"Quack, quack, quack, quack."  
But only four little ducks came back.  

Four little ducks  
Went out one day

But only three little ducks came back.

Went out one day  
Over the hill and far away  
Mother duck said  
"Quack, quack, quack, quack."  
But only one little duck came back.  

One little duck  
Went out one day  
Over the hill and far away  
Mother duck said  
"Quack, quack, quack, quack."  
But none of the five little ducks came back.  

Sad mother duck  
Went out one day  
Over the hill and far away  
The sad mother duck said  
"Quack, quack, quack."  
And all of the five little ducks came back.

###The Farmer in the Dell

ï»¿The farmer in the dell  
The farmer in the dell  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The farmer in the dell  

And the farmer takes a wife  
The farmer takes a wife  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The farmer takes a wife  

And the wife takes the child  
The wife takes the child  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The wife takes the child  

And the child takes the nurse  
The child takes the nurse  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The child takes the nurse  

And the nurse takes the dog  
The nurse takes the dog  
Hi-ho, the derry-o

And the dog takes the cat  
The dog takes the cat  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The dog takes the cat  

And the cat takes the mouse  
The cat takes the mouse  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The cat takes the mouse  

And the mouse takes the cheese  
The mouse takes the cheese  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The mouse takes the cheese  

And the cheese stands alone  
The cheese stands alone  
Hi-ho, the derry-o  
The cheese stands alone
