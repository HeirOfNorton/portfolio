...

Ladies and gentlemen of Rotary International, thank you for allowing me to speak to you today.
I am here to tell you about the job of an archivist; what we do, and why we do it that way.
A lot of people think of archives as relics, dusty old tombs of papers that no one uses or needs any more.
I would like to clear that up, today.

The point of an archives, and from that the point of an archivist, is to preserve history.
We collect and catalog records, manuscripts, and anything else relevant in order to record the history of some subject.
An archivist is, in essence, a curator of history.
However, we do not simply hoard all the knowledge we can grab; we collect and preserve things specifically so that others may find them and use them, and so that the history we preserve can be remembered and people can learn from it.

I have heard some people ask if there is really any need for archivists any more, when everything is online and can be found with Google.
Well, first of all, who do you think _puts_ everything online?
When it comes to important historical documents, chances are it was an archivist.
Second, everything is _not_ online.
Only a tiny fraction of information available has been or can be found on the internet, for a number of different reasons.
Finally, and most importantly, Google only works if you know precisely what you want to find.
Google will not know the context of what you can find, the depth and breadth of what is available, and Google will not know where else to look for information that it does not have in its database.
For that, you need an archivist.

So, I've told you what an archivist _is_, but how about what an archivist _does_?
The job of an archivist can, roughly, be broken down into three parts:
Collecting materials, processing them, and making them available to researchers and other users.

Collecting is, in some ways, the simplest.
It just means finding and taking a look at records and materials, and deciding if they should go into the collection or not.
Some archives work hand-in-hand with an organization to preserve their records specifically.
Other archives seek out records on a particular theme or from a particular historical period.
Just as one example, your own organization has an archives in Lincolnwood, Illinois that gathers up materials showing the history of the Rotary Club.

So what is a record, for an archivist?
Depending on the archives, a record can be almost anything.
Papers, manuscripts and letters are the most commonly thought of archival records.
Photos, sound records, videos, even databases or web pages can also be records.
Even my copy of this speech or the receipt for what you had for breakfast could be a record, and that's where collecting gets complicated.

Anything _can_ be a record, but not everything _should_ be collected.
That receipt for breakfast this morning is probably not really important.
No archives have the room to collect everything available, or even everything that is potentially relevant.
An archivist must decide what is important enough to be kept, and what is not.
Sometimes this means working with a company to work out what gets stored for later and what gets shredded.
Sometimes this means working with donors to decide whether to accept a gift of a collection, or to politely refuse it if it doesn't fit with the purpose and scope of a particular archives.
We have to choose what documents give the most complete picture of events without overwhelming researchers with unneeded and useless extras.

Still, one way or another we collect stuff for the archives.
At that point, the archivist's job is still only starting.
Those papers aren't any good to anyone just sitting in a box on a shelf somewhere.
We need to make sure they are ready for researchers, and make sure they can be found.

The first thing an archivist often does with a new collection is to find the best way to arrange all of the items in the collection.
Everything needs to be sorted, and put together in a way that is organized and useful.
Archivists also, wherever possible, try to do that in a way that keeps items together in the same order as we found them, because this often gives important context to the records.
Say we did decide to preserve that receipt for breakfast after all.
If it was kept on its own, or in a folder full of random receipts, then it probably doesn't tell a researcher much.
If it is instead kept with the other papers it was originally with, we might find that everything adds together and allows a researcher to build a more detailed picture of events.
Maybe having that receipt next to notes written during the breakfast helps explain why you were suddenly interested in orange juice futures.

Of course, even having perfectly arranged collections does not help much unless researchers know they are there.
The other major action done with new collections is to describe them.
The archivist makes what is called a finding aid, a new document that is kind of like an entry in a catalog that describes the collection in general, who made it and how the archives got ahold of it, and what specifically is included in the collection.
The name "finding aid" was not chosen on accident, as it does more than a simple catalog entry would do.
The finding aid is the main way that researchers decide if a collection is worthwhile, and whether or not it includes something they need to see, so it must be complete and thorough while still being concise enough that researchers do not simply skip past it.

Creating the finding aid is just one step in making the archive collection available to users.
Again, the point of an archives is not just to preserve history, but to preserve it so that it can be remembered and used.
Without researchers using the archives, it is little more than a big safe holding papers.
The last part of an archivist's job is to provide the collection to users who need access to it.

The main way archivists achieve this is by providing reference service for the collection.
I'm sure most of you have been to a library at some point, and you would have seen the librarian at the desk inviting you to ask any questions.
An archivist does the same thing, but in much greater detail and depth.
Researchers can come from all over the world, or may not even be able to visit in person, but they still need to go through the archives because they cannot find what they need anywhere else.
The archivist will, as much as possible, work with researchers to help them find precisely the documents they need.
Sometimes this even means doing part of the research ourselves, digging into the collection to discover what gems might be hiding within, and following leads to other documents, other collection, and possibly even other archives in a different part of the country.
We need to balance our time so that all the work gets done and all of our users are helped, but within those limits we do everything we can to help our users since without them, the archives is worthless.

We are also starting to offer as much as we can online so that it is easier to find and use for researchers.
I know I said earlier that only a fraction of the information available could possibly be put online.
This is mostly because of the time and cost of actually scanning, fixing, and posting each document to the web, as well as legal and copyright concerns.
Nonetheless, we are still trying to make as much available online as possible.
The internet is more and more the preferred way to find information, and we are doing our best to keep up with that trend for the benefit of our users.

Finally, archivists try to make sure that as much archival material is preserved as possible, and that researchers can find the information they need as much as possible, by collaborating with other institutions.
As I said, no archives can keep every document, and often they are not able to keep every document that is relevant to their scope and mission.
We work past this limitation by working together, making sure that something important is preserved, even if it is at a different archives.
We also cooperate with one another, pointing researches to other archives when that is where their research should take them.
Archives do not exist in a vacuum, and if two archives compete for the same resources then they will both lose.
By working together, we improve the field for everyone.

Former president of Rotary International H.J. Brunnier once wrote that "the things that are worthwhile take time, and it is not the _I's_ of the world but the _We's_ who achieve them" (1952).
That time must be preserved, and the things that are worthwhile must be known if they are to last beyond the moment.
Archivists keep record of what has gone before, and allow individuals from many times and places to learn from one another and to, together, become the "_We's_" who change the world.

Thank you for your time and for listening to me today.
