The Charles Babbage Institute (CBI) is an archives and research center dedicated to the history of Information Technology and Computing.
CBI was founded in 1978 in Palo Alto, California, but since 1989 has been located at the University of Minnesota as a part of the university's Archives & Special Collections department.
CBI sponsors and conducts research into the history of information technology, including grants and fellowships for researchers, while the archives collects primary source materials from organizations and individuals who have been important in developing the field of computing and related technology.

CBI has on staff a director and associate director, rotating researchers, and an executive assistant.
For the CBI archives itself the only permanent staff is the archivist, R. Arvid Nelsen, as well as a part-time student assistant to the archivist.
In times past the archives had additional students and staff, as well as specialized staff for acquisitions processing, but budget cuts in the last few years have reduced staff to the archivist and his assistant.
This is in part offset by staff and resource sharing with other archives at the university.
Mr. Nelsen was gracious enough to take the time to talk with me about the process and operation of the archives, as well as take me on a tour of the archives holdings.

As mentioned, CBI is one part of the University of Minnesota's Archives and Special Collections department.
As a result, the CBI archives share space and resources with several other archives and the school.
The main, public face of all these archives is the Elmer L. Andersen library on the Minneapolis campus.
This library includes a gallery used by the different archives in turn for exhibits---CBI has had three exhibits since Mr. Nelsen has been archivist---office suites for each unit, and a shared reading room that is monitored at all times.

The bulk of the archives' holdings are kept in secure and climate-controlled storage in excavated caverns beneath the Andersen Library.
Mr. Nelsen took me down to these caverns as part of the tour.
There are currently two parallel caverns, with plans for a third if budget ever allows, carved out of sandstone sixty-five feet underground.
The doors leading to the elevator down, as well as nearly every door within the caverns, are secured with keycard-access locks.
The caverns on their own offer an almost ideal environment for archival storage, allowing minimal climate control to maintain temperature and humidity.

There is a central processing room immediately accessible.
Nearly all processing is done in-house at the university archives, and most processing is done by a central team rather than each archives having its own processing staff, to save on costs.
Past the dock for truck access, and a positive-pressure "airlock" hallway keeping out exhaust fumes, are the main storage shelves.
This "Indiana Jones Room"---nicknamed after the warehouse from _Raiders of the Lost Ark_---has high-bay shelving reaching twenty feet off the floor, most of them packed full and shelved by height of materials to maximize space.
Archivists and processing or retrieval staff can use tall ladders or a forklift to reach the tallest shelves.
According to Mr. Nelsen, most of the accessible collections are located in the bottom eight shelves, with higher shelves used for low-access items and unprocessed collections.

A second cavern holds the "Mezzanine", rows of shelves that are only head-high and are easily searched and accessed.
These are used for popular and high-access materials so they can be more-easily retrieved without risk of injury.
Within both the Mezzanine and the larger main cavern, each archives has its own dedicated shelf space---CBI, for example, holds rows 6--18 in the Mezzanine.
This is a remnant from previous decades when each archives operated completely independently.
Now each archives, while still somewhat independent, works by necessity as part of the larger department in order to share expertise and pool resources.
It is likely that, if the third cavern is ever built, collections from different archives will be filed amongst one another in order to make more efficient use of space, since all materials are stored and retrieved by a central service anyway.

There is also offsite storage used at least by CBI, requiring multiple days for retrieval for anyone wishing to view the materials within.
I did not have the opportunity to see this storage as part of the tour.

As he showed in the archives, Mr. Nelsen described to me the scope of the CBI archives and how it has changed over the years.
Originally, CBI collected only original papers from persons and organizations relating to Information Technology, with a very strict collection policy all but forbidding other materials.
This has been relaxed in more recent years, and the archives now include books and manuals that provide important context for the other materials, periodicals and trade publications, as well as numerous films and photographs that document this history.
CBI also has an extensive collection of oral histories which document parts of the history of computing that would otherwise go unknown.
CBI specifically does not collect three dimensional materials or artifacts, though they did bend this rule when IBM offered them one of the original BlueGene/L supercomputers.
It is now on display at the U of M's College of Science & Engineering, serving as free advertising for the archives.

The greatest challenges facing the archives, aside from (as always) budget, are to process the backlog of materials and to find room for them and new materials coming in.
Space is very much at a premium, as are resources and hours for processing, and the archives always seems to be behind.
CBI is fortunate in that the creators of the collections they acquire are often very organized and rigorous with their papers, so it is not uncommon for collections to come in "pre"-processed.
One example given is a recent collection acquired from Lockheed-Martin, comprising six palettes of records and papers that were already organized and indexed in far greater detail than would have ever been possible if done by the archivist at CBI.
On the other hand, the backlog required Mr. Nelsen and his student assistant, Ian, to spend several days sorting through a collection of 500 boxes of computer manuals, most of which were unneeded or redundant.
Most of these were deaccessioned in this marathon processing in order to make room for the collection from Lockheed-Martin.

This premium on space has caused CBI to become much more picky about what collections they can accept, and to more actively seek to most useful and relevant collections instead of simply waiting to see what comes in from donors.
Nonetheless, they still receive new collections and requests to take donations every week, and often find that donors do not know the value (or lack thereof) of their collections.
One current problem they face is a large collection that came in as a deed of gift, much larger and of a higher monetary value than was originally said by the donor.
The collection must be professionally appraised by an independent contractor before it can even be touched, and until then it sits in boxes lined up against the wall in the main office.
In the meantime, the archives are negotiating for the records of the Association for Computing Machinery, and has feelers out for the records or DARPA and the IEEE.

The Charles Babbage Institute archives, like all of the archives at the University of Minnesota, are available to the public upon request, and research is encouraged.
I was particularly impressed with how the archives have grown beyond a strict interpretation of Information Technology history, and attempt the show the greater context of the world around computers and as it is affected by computers.
Arvid Nelsen said that he tries to "read across the grain of the collection," and has in particular encouraged research into social issues in computing and as revealed by the history of computing.
The audience for a collection may be bigger than any one researcher or archivist realizes, ad CBI is trying to embrace this diversity while still keeping within its mission of documenting the history of Information Technology.
