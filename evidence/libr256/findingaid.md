##BIOGRAPHICAL/HISTORY NOTE:

Eric Theodore "Ted" Carlson was from Middletown, Connecticut, and was a chemist and engineer who served in the US Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. Ted graduated with honors from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in Chemistry. He began graduate studies at Iowa State College, but was shortly conscripted into the army.

Ted was inducted into the US Army on August 1, 1944, and was processed at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. He was assigned to the Enlisted Reserve Corps and ordered to report to Detroit, Michigan, to begin work at the Chrysler Corporation. His work included work on the atomic bomb that was later used in the war against Japan.

After the end of the war, Ted was called to active duty and October 15, 1945. He attended basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was afterward assigned to the Monsanto Chemical Company in Dayton Ohio. Ted requested a discharge from the army in March, 1946, which was approved and he was discharged on April 7, 1946. Ted moved to New York in August, 1946, to attend medical school at Cornell Medical College.

##SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE:

The Eric Theodore Carlson Papers, 1944-1947, consist mainly of the personal correspondence of Eric "Ted" Carlson, as well as additional papers and records. This includes letters to and from Ted's parents, and letters from several of Ted's friends and colleagues. There are also records reflecting Ted' education at Wesleyan University and Iowa State College, and his conscription and duty served in the Army Corps of Engineers.

The bulk of the collection consists of letters from Ted to his parents in Norwich, Connecticut (Series I). These letters date from January, 1944, to December, 1946. In them Ted describes his day-to-day life at college, in the Army after his conscription, his work at Chrysler, including his revelation that he worked on the atomic bomb, and his attempts to receive a discharge and beginning studies at medical school.

A somewhat smaller part of the collection includes letters sent to Ted (Series II.). These include letters from his parents, written by his father, dating from 1944-1947. There are several letters from Sam, a friend at Cornell Medical College, dated 1944-1945. There are also letters from friends Bob, Chet, Roger, and Arvid. Like Ted's letters, these largely focus on day-to-day life, with discussion of politics, school, and dating.

Series III consists of additional papers and records giving evidence of Ted's life during this period. Subseries A has records from Wesleyan University, from which Ted graduated with honors, and from Iowa State College, where he was a graduate student majoring in Organic Chemistry before his conscription. Subseries B contains Ted's Military records, including his conscription and induction in July and August of 1944, his processing at Fort Snelling and orders to join the Enlisted Reserve Corps, his time at the Chrysler Corporation, his recall to active duty, and finally his request for and approved discharge. Subseries C includes other papers, including a copy of the Bulletin of the Dayton Scientist from July, 1946, of which Ted was an editor.
