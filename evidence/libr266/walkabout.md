...

I begin at what seems to be the central hub of my neighborhood, which is the Rosedale Shopping Center.
Rosedale is a large and fairly upscale shopping mall, with many high-end stores and specialty boutiques.
It is a mall that does not have a food court full of fast food, but rather has a string of restaurants around its "rotunda".
At first glance, many of the people who work and shop there appear to reflect this, being a mix of both young and middle-aged but largely well-dressed, and solidly middle-class.
As I look closer, though, I see another side of the clientele.
Rosedale plays host to large number of immigrants, from a variety of nations.
I often pass by Somali families, likely once refugees but now they, and in particular their children, are becoming fully integrated.
There are nearly as many Hmong shoppers and employees, as well as quite a number of people from India, China, or Egypt.
I can sit in one place and hear half a dozen languages at any given time.
Still, most of the shopper, whatever their nation of origin, seem just as solidly middle class in their dress and habits.

The prospects for a library collection at first appear positive.
Middle class families, well-to-do but not truly wealthy, are often the greatest supporters of the public library.
With the large number of immigrants, a collection will need materials for learning English as well as integrating into American society.
With such a large number of diverse cultures represented, it will be difficult to cater to everyone to make sure their interests are met.
By far the greatest number appear to be Somali immigrants, suggesting a need for materials in Somali, as well as works of interest to Muslims.
The same is true for Hmong, though to a different extent.
There is likely less need for materials relating to integration for Hmong people since most have been here longer, many even born and raised here, as the first wave of immigration was during the Vietnam war.
There is likely just as strong a desire for the means to help preserve their culture here, though, especially as they do not have a Hmong nation to which they could conceivably return some day.

The area immediately around the mall reflects a similar middle class sensibility.
Access controlled apartment buildings and well-kept houses are the norm, with new apartment buildings built each year, though of course there is no construction now during the frozen dead of winter.
As I pass by, I say hello and stop to chat with people in the neighborhood.
Most of the people I meet are in their 40s or older, mostly the same well-dressed bunch I saw at the mall.
More Republicans than Democrats, though political talk is limited to mild complaints about the economy and how the last election went.
Nothing too heated or vitriolic, and there is much more discussion about the weather.
Many appear to carry a book with them to read wherever they are going.
A few have eReaders or Kindles, but only a few, and many people mention how little they like to use computers or other newer gadgets.
Many do not even own a computer, and avoid them if they can help it, but realize that they will not be able to avoid them for much longer.

Despite the overall well-to-do feel of the neighborhood, many are feeling the pinch of the recession, and many are looking for work if they are not already working multiple jobs.
A library collection to cater to this crowd would do well to have materials for both job hunting and current job skills.
Computer skills are a particularly large need, though for now many do not want to admit it.
Many locals need, or soon will need, help learning even basic computer use.
Many feel embarrassed by this need, and would not appreciate anything that seems to be condescending or with too much blatant hand-holding, but they do recognize their own need.
Any kind of job or skill based materials will need to be monitored carefully so they remain current, as they are both rapidly moving targets at the moment.
Political works also have an audience in this neighborhood, though at the moment many feel burnt out on the very long election cycle and may not want to read anything political until they have "recovered" from it.

I make my way a bit further south, and I start to see the face of the neighborhood change.
Gradually the stucco and wood apartment buildings give way to red brick, the lawns get smaller and the cars get older, and Romano's Grill is replaced by McDonald's and Burger King.
Along with the buildings, the people are also different.
Most are younger, in their twenties and thirties, with more children around as well.
They are also much more diverse, with African Americans equal or even outnumbering Caucasians, while the northern part of the neighborhood was largely whitewashed.
Still, the conversations are mostly similar, with people looking for a job (or another one), worrying about their children's health, and of course complaining about the weather.
Materials for job hunting and job skills would be just as important for the people at this end of the neighborhood, if not more so.
This group will also appreciate a collection of children's materials, works to keep the kids learning or entertained, especially those parents who need to work a second job and so rely on after school and library programs to keep their children safe and occupied into the afternoon.

It is about at this point that I realize something strange.
The makeup of the neighborhood, whether the poorer southern end or the better-off norther end, seems very different from what I saw at the mall at the beginning.
While I have seen or met a large number of African Americans in my journey, they all appear to be American born and raised.
Since I left the mall, I have not seen a single Somali person, and only a very few Asians who may or may not be Hmong.
At the mall, it is clear that immigrants make up a large and important part of the population of this area, but right outside you would be hard-pressed to realize that there were any immigrants living nearby.
It is clear to me that it is very difficult to make assumptions about a community based on simple observation, even if you think you are observing a representative neighborhood.
As it is, I am even less confident that I know who lives in the neighborhood than I was when I started, as I have seen first hand how wrong I can be from too limited a view, and I do not know if my view is broad enough to be true yet.
To get a true picture of my community, I would need to double check any observations with real data, probably census data, so that I can say with confidence who my neighbors are.
