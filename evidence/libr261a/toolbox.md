Introduction
------------

This annotated bibliography is presented from the point of view of an experienced librarian specializing in teen library services.
It is arranged in several broad categories, including General resources of YA information, online portals and directories, and practical guides and resources, ending with resources for collection development.

General Resources for YA Information
------------------------------------

###Publishers of Professional Materials###

Libraries Unlimited. Westport, CT.

Libraries Unlimited, an imprint of ABC-CLIO, has built up a large catalog of textbooks and reference works for librarians.
Their authors are working or experiences librarians from the field, and they have several volumes covering aspects of young adult services.
Their current offerings for young adult services largely cover broad topics, such as youth services in general or building a full teen service program.
They do have more specific volumes for collection development, including separate titles for visual media and web sites.
On the whole, however, their titles keep the broad view, and do not have the depth of coverage offered by Neal-Schuman.

Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. New York, NY.

Neal-Schuman also has a long history and large catalog of textbooks and reference works for young adult librarians.
They have been around for several decades, and are now an imprint of the American Library Association.
Like Libraries Unlimited, Neal-Schuman has several titles about broad aspects of YA service as well as several titles for different aspects of collection development.
Neal-Schuman goes beyond this, though, with volumes on more specific challenges in library service, such as serving LGBTQ teens and advocacy for teens and ten services.
This more in-depth coverage is why I recommend Neal-Schuman over Libraries Unlimited.

###Journals for Young Adult Librarians###

Hughes-Hassell, S. (Ed.). _Journal of Research on Libraries and Young Adults_. Online publication (was quarterly). Chicago, IL: American Library Association. <http://www.yalsa.ala.org/jrlya/>

JRLYA is still a very new journal, published online only by YALSA.
As it says, it is a research journal, offering a peer-reviewed and scholarly home for essays and studies relating to young adult library service.
This journal fills a much needed gap in the scholarship for YA library services, but for now it remains too new and too small.
As the only research journal for this area, it tries to do too much with too little, and its usefulness suffers for it.

Honnold, R. (Ed.-in-Chief). _Voice of Youth Advocates_. Bimonthly publication. Bowie, MD: E L Kurdyla Publishing.

VOYA has been a premier journal for young adult library services since it began publication in the seventies.
The journal takes a position of practicality, and advocacy, with columns and articles both celebrating successful practices and pushing for improved service for teens from all libraries.
Regular features also review current books for teens and describe teen spaces that have been created at libraries.
The journal does not have the same scholarly background or approach that JRLYA has, but it makes up for it in broad application and practical advice.
In the day-to-day working of a library, VOYA is a much more useful resource.

###Local Community News Sources###

Turck, M. (Ed.). _Twin Cities Daily Planet_. Online Newspaper. Minneapolis, MN: Twin Cities Media Alliance. <http://www.tcdailyplanet.net>

The _Daily Planet_ is a website that gathers local news for the Twin Cities area.
It is not specifically focused on news relating to young adults, but two of its major categories---Education and Youth Policy---are focused on youth interests.
It is an excellent resource for finding local events and headlines around the metro without the clutter and advertising that is on the sites of the local major newspapers.
Unfortunately, though it helps to find news items about young adults, it only finds those items, and the sections on upcoming evens or local flavor do not allow any way to focus on teen interest.

Hoffman, K. (Ed.). _City Pages_. Weekly publication. Minneapolis, MN: City Pages LLC.

The _City Pages_, unlike _Daily Planet_, is a weekly newsprint that is focused almost entirely on the "Arts and Lifestyle" in the Twin Cities, and in particular the current trends that would be of interest to young adults.
The paper has sections for current pop culture and local events, as well as recent politics and news.
The paper does include some "adult" topics and does not censor itself, which may cause tension with some parents or administrators.
On the whole, though the _City Pages_ does not have the same coverage of "real" news as the _Daily Planet_, there is much more here that is relevant to most teens.

Online Portals and Directories
------------------------------

###Websites for YA Librarians###

Webjunction. (2012). _Young Adults & Teens_. Retrieved from <http://www.webjunction.org/explore-topics/ya-teens.html>

This portal created by the OCLC is intended to cover many aspects of creating and improving young adults service in a library.
It includes a section of industry news, a folder of usable documents for SLIS education and current practice, and a series of web-based seminars to help learn to improve service.
The topic coverage is wide, and many of the webinars and included resources go into good detail about their topics.
Unfortunately, there are still not a very large number of those topics.
The links and resources included are useful, but there remain too few of them.

Jensen, K., Wilkes, S., Gibrich, C. R., Booth, H., & Creech, Cuyler. (2012). _TLT: Teen Librarian's Toolbox_. Retrieved from <http://www.teenlibrariantoolbox.com>

TLT is built as a blog for young adult librarians, but the final product goes well beyond the limits of most blogs to a thorough and detailed site.
The articles published here are well sorted into important topics, including "Teen Services 101," advocacy, book reviews, and collection development.
Within these topics, each article goes into depth on the topic, giving great advice and guideline for building or improving the teen services in a library.
The articles could be made easier to search, and could offer more external resources or books to consult in addition to what is given by the blog authors themselves.
Nonetheless, it remains a very strong resource which much more practical use than the webjunction page.

###Podcasts for YA Librarians###

_YA Literature Review_. (2012). Retrieved from <http://yalitreview.libsyn.com>

This is a podcast radio program focusing on young adult literature.
The creators offer reviews of current books, as well as interviews with authors.
The episodes each focus on one book or author, and go in depth on the strengths and weaknesses of the writing, and the history behind it.
While the program does cover a variety of YA novels, it only covers books and authors, and does not all for as much variety of material as the podcasts from ComicPop.

Brookman, R., Dressler, C., Moyer, M., Brookman, A., Brookman, L, Brookman, M, Coalwell, M., Kitts, R., & Rowland, V. (2012). _ComicPop Library Podcasts_. Retrieved from <http://comicpoplibrary.com>

_ComicPop Library_ is also largely a review site aimed at materials of interest to young adult librarians, but with a much broader range of materials covered.
As suggested by the name, the podcast performers review graphic novels, but the also review science fiction and fantasy fiction, music, and video games.
They also have interviews with media creators and information on anime and comic book conventions.
While their material is not specifically for young adults, the items they cover are of interest to many teens, much more so than simply books, and the information they cover would be important and relevant to many teens as well.
This high level of interest and greater variety of coverage makes it much more useful than the _YA Lit review_ podcast.

###Wikis for YA Librarians###

Young Adult Library Services Association. (2012) _YALSA Wiki_. Retrieved from <http://wikis.ala.org/yalsa/index.php/Main_Page>

This wiki, a collaborative web site with several interlinked articles, was created by YALSA as a central repository of useful information on young adult services.
It has several sections for current YALS news, articles on advocacy, general resources, research, and more.
Each article goes into a great deal of detail, offering a thorough overview of the presented topic.
The articles are biased very heavily toward resources created (or sold) by YALSA, but those resources remain very well made.
Though I would have liked more variety of selected resources, the overall quality and depth of the content makes this the better wiki for younf adult librarians.

Tilley, C., LaBarre, K., Rancani, L., & Martaus, A. (2012). _Youth Services Librarianship_. Retrieved from <http://youthserviceslibrarianship.wikispaces.com>

This wiki was created by several graduate students from the University of Illinois, and more recent students continue to add to and update the wiki.
The articles created for it go into detail about the challenges inherent in each aspect of providing service for teens, and they provide additional links to outside resources and detailed bibliographies of resources.
It also covers some topics that are passed over by YALSA's wiki, such as adolescent development as it relates to libraries, and collection development challenges face by school and public libraries.
Though it remains an excellent resource, the wiki from YALSA nonetheless still has greater coverage and greater quality in the individual articles.

###Blogs for YA Librarians###

Dezurick-Badran, E. (2012). _YA Library UK_. Retrieved from <http://yalibraryuk.org>

This blog has a number of articles on the challenges facing young adult specialist librarians within the United Kingdom.
Though, of course, many of these articles will not apply to librarians within the United States, many of the articles are more general and can be used for librarians of either nation.
The articles cover many useful topics, though there does seem to be some holdover of the old attitude of teens as potential "problems" who need to be controlled.

Vollick, S., Walker, E., Dawley, A., & Waters, J. (2012). _CLASY: Canadian Libraries Are Serving Youth_. Retrieved from <http://clasy.wordpress.com>

This blog also presents articles for teen library service, again from a nation other that the US, though this one is much closer.
Like _YA Library UK_, some of the advice will not apply to librarians in the US, but most of the general advice and resources are still useful.
The blog includes booklists and pathfinders to help grow a library's collection.
Unfortunately, while it does have some useful articles, they can be difficult to find in between the many posts that, while very useful for Canadian librarians, are useless for Americans.
_YA Library UK_ simple has a greater amount of content that is useful for all librarians, and not just those in the same country.

Scholarly Research
------------------

###Reference Tools On/About Young People###

Eagle, M. (2012). _Answering teens' tough questions_. Chicago, IL: Neal-Schuman Publishers.

This book goes into depth about the many challenges and questions faced by teens today, and how best a librarian can try to help them.
On the surface it is presented as a practical guide for how to answer difficult reference questions from teens.
It goes beyond this, though, in an attempt to help librarians understand the people, the teens, who would be asking these questions.
In teaching how to answer the most important questions a teen might ask, it teaches readers about those teens, and where they are coming from.
This focus does bias it toward teen _problems_, but it remains a great resource for understanding teens.

Pierce, J. B. (2008). _Sex, brains, and video games: A librarians guide to teens in the twenty-first century_. Chicago, IL: American Library Association.

This book on teen development and culture also tries to help the reader understand modern teens.
Where Eagle's work tried to explain the inner mentality and experience of teens, this is nearly the opposite in explaining the outer physiology and culture of modern teens.
It seeks to dispel common myths so that librarians can give up their preconceived notions and learn about teens as individuals.
It does not present much from a teen perspective, one way in which it is weaker than Eagle's book, but its focus on current culture will make it more practically useful for most librarians.

###Scholarly Monographs on YA Library Services###

Agosto, D. E., & Abbas, J., eds. (2011). _Teens, libraries, and social networking: What librarians need to know_. Santa Barbara, CA: Libraries Unlimited.

This collection of research will help librarians understand social networking, not just how it is used and will affect the library, but in how it is becoming an integral part of modern teen culture.
Social networking platforms are becoming ubiquitous among young adults, and are affecting how they develop socially.
This will also change how librarians will best be able to serve them.
There is a risk of falling out of date quickly with a work like this, but for now it is current and gives a good analysis of the topic.

Cvetkovic, V. B., & Lackie, R. J., eds. (2009). _Teaching generation M: a handbook for librarians and educators_. New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers.

This work also focusses on new technology and how it affects the way younger people learn and interact with one another and with adults.
The research involved is presented from the point of view of using the new technology to help teach and provide service for teens.
This is useful information, as an understanding of how social networking is used is becoming more and more necessary for providing service to young people.
However, this volume lacks the focus of Agosto & Abbas, and tries to cover too much that is not directly related.

###Contemporary Youth Culture - Non-LIS###

Clark, C. (2011). _Hurt 2.0: Inside the world of today's teenagers_. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic.

This volume is an attempt to explain the world from the point of view of a teen, for the purpose of helping them through the "difficult" times.
It includes a wide variety of topics, and is thoroughly researched to back up most claims about what teens like and what they _are_ like.
The work has good intentions, all of the chapters attempting to offer ways to improve things for teens.
However, the author also clearly has a particular bias, completely convinced that teens are systemically "abandoned" by society when the research does not support it thoroughly.

Richards, C. (2011). _Young people, popular culture and education_. New York, NY: Continuum International.

This work, on the other hand, attempts to forego common biases and present current teen and popular culture neutrally.
While it certainly has an angle---it is a text for improving the education of teens---it uses that angle to explore and explain teen pop culture in a way that adults who do not participate in the same pop culture can understand.
The book is divided into several of the most common topics, including different media and different social aspects of culture such as politics and racial identity.
It does not give much information on any specific current pop culture; it attempts to stay current longer by not mentioning specific things that may be gone within a few years.
Still, the lack of bias and broad coverage keep it useful for librarians today.

###Institutional Research Studies###

Ito, M., Horst, H. A., Bittanti, M., Boyd, D., Herr-Stephenson, B., Lange, P. G., . . . Tripp, L. (2008). _Kids' informal learning with digital media: An ethnographic investigation of innovative knowledge cultures_. Retrieved from <http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report>

This large study was conducted by a joint team at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Berkely, in order to gauge how much and in what ways today's youth use modern digital technology.
They found that modern teens mostly use technology to socialize, and many are in near-constant contact with their peers and friends even if the do not physically meet one another very often.
They also found that teens will often use technology to teach themselves about topics that interest them, and that librarians can and should encourage this new learning method.
This report, and the book made out of the data later, is a very useful resource for proving the use and need of newer technology int he library.

Nielsen Company. (2009) _How teens use media_. Retrieved from <http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/reports/nielsen_howteensusemedia_june09.pdf>

This reports from the Nielsen company also studies how teens use technology, and in particular seeks to dispel common myths about how much teens watch television and use other forms of mass media.
They found that today's teens in fact watch less television than nearly any other age group, as well as do less web-surfing online, but they do listen to the radio for music, go to the movies, and use social networking platforms more than others.
This study would be useful for collection development, to show what teens are after _besides_ books.
However, it has a clear bias toward selling and broadcast earnings---Nielsen is a commercial company, after all---and the report by Ito and her team is more verifiable and scholarly, the better to use for such situations.

Practical Resources
-------------------

###Practitioner Manuals/Guides on YA Library Services###

Braun, L. W. (2012). _Being a teen library services advocate_. Chicago, IL: Neal-Schuman Publishers.

This guide covers, step by step, the different tools and actions available to a teen services librarian to advocate both for teens in general and the YA services in specific.
It covers both working to improve the service, and "selling" the service to others in the library and the community so that the library can continue to improve that service.
While it goes into a great deal of detail about ways to help convince others that YA services are necessary and effective, it ends up giving short shrift to to process of advocating for teens themselves.
It remains a good resource, and the greater focus makes it more useful than Ludwig's guide.

Ludwig, S. (2011). _Starting from scratch: Building a teen library program_. Santa Barbara, CA: Libraries Unlimited.

While Braun's guide gave ways to improve and advocate for teen services, this guide is about creating young adult services in a library that does not already have a separate department for it.
It covers building the space and the collection, but focusses on creating the culture of young adult service in the library, regardless of space.
In this way, it also has advice for advocating for teen services, and convincing administrators and staff that they should be giving better service and supporting the changes.
It is broadly useful for a library that truly is starting from scratch, but for most libraries much of it will prove unnecessary, so Braun's guide would be the better choice for improving teen services within a library.

###Training Resources###

Library Staff Development. (2012). Serving Children & Teens. Retrieved from <http://librarystaffdevelopment.wikispaces.com/Serving+Children+&+Teens>

This page, part of a larger wiki that is all about library staff training and learning, gives several ways to help improve training within the library for young adult services.
Besides a few general resources, there is a training "class" made up of several videos, as well as several printable documents that may be used as part of a training program.
The resources given are useful, but they do not cover a large number of topics, making it difficult to add more training when it becomes needed.

DeWalt, M. (2011). _SABLE Course: Young adult services_. Retrieved from <http://lili.org/forlibs/ce/sable/course3/>

This is a series of four online courses created for the Idaho Commission for Libraries.
Each course covers a specific topic such as youth development and outreach.
While the resources from Library Staff Development were individual documents that could be accessed in an way, this is a directed course, more like a traditional classroom, though still self-paced thanks to its online nature.
While the courses are detailed, the format proves to be very inflexible.
It would be useful for learning, but the resources from Library Staff Development would end up being better, and easier to adapt, for another library.

###Program Evaluation Resources###

Flowers, S. (2012). _Evaluating teen services and programs_. Chicago, IL: Neal Schuman Publishers.

This volume takes the reader step by step through the different ways of conducting, evaluating, reviewing, and improving the young adult services in the library.
It is not limited to any single program, but rather gives techniques for evaluating the service as a whole, as well as how to track whether it is improving or not when changes are made.
It includes but qualitative and quantitative analysis, and guides for how to implement this at a library.
It does not give much information about specific programs or techniques that could be introduced to a library, but the information included if perfect for showing how to evaluate what is already there.

Gorman, M., & Suellentrop, T. (2009). _Connecting young adults and libraries_. 4th ed. New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers.

This volume takes a broader view from the one by Flowers.
It attempts to explain both young adult service as a whole and specific programs that will be popular and effective in the library.
It does describe how to evaluate these programs and services, but it does not do so in as much detail as Flowers, as it has cast a much wider net.
While the information in here is useful, and parts of it may work as a handbook for implementing services or programs in general, the work by Flowers is a much better tool for evaluating the effectiveness of young adult services in a library.

Collection Development
----------------------

###Collection Development Tools (Published)###

Welch, R. J. (2011). _A core collection for young adults_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers.

This work attempts to be the booklist of booklists for young adults.
Over 1300 individual works are included, all separated and categorized so it is easy to browse through and discover gaps in the collection.
Many of the books are annotated, describing not only the plot but also what teens would be interested in them, and what specifically about them they would find interesting.
It suffers from being limited to just books.
Lists of popular or important books are easy enough to find, and while the annotations add value that could be used for reader's advisory, they do not add enough to make up for the limits.

Harlan, M. A., Loertscher, D. V., & McElmeel, S. L. (2011). _Young adult literature and multimedia: A quick guide_. 7th ed. Salt Lake City, UT: Learning Commons.

This volume, on the other hand, does not attempt to list every single work that could be wanted.
It is limited to a relatively few important works in each category.
It makes up for this by giving a great deal of background on each category, so that a librarian can understand the genre itself and figure out how to find more works from there.
It also does not limit itself to just books, including sections for movies, video games, manga, and other media that are bemoing more popular with yong adults.
The variety of resources and tools for understanding that variety make this a much more valuable tool than Welch's booklist.

###Collection Development Tools (web-based)###

Buehrlen, M. G. (2012). _Young adult books central_. Retrieved from <http://www.yabookscentral.com/>

This website has reviews for hundreds of current and classic books for young adults.
Many books are reviewed in depth, and all are given ratings both by critics and by readers of the site.
The large collection of reviews and information would be useful both for collection development, and for reader's advisory.
Like other tools, it suffers from only including books, and mostly fiction, but for what it has it is very well done.

Bertland, L. (2012). _Selection tools for school librarians_. Retrieved from <http://www.sldirectory.com/libsf/resf/selection.html>

This collection of resources has several links intended to help with collection development.
It links to several specialized resources for particular types or genres of book, including categories such as science, horror, and graphic novels.
It also links to resources to help build the collection via online databases, and software reviews, so the you are not limited to just books in the collection.
The site could be better presented and categorized, but it is an excellent resource for developing the entire collection, and not just the book collection, making it of more general usefulness than YA Book Central.

###Youth-Produced Media###

Jones, L., & Kamal, M. (2011). _Youth radio_. Retrieved from <http://www.youthradio.us>

_Youth Radio_ is the website of an entirely youth-produced radio series, with news and articles on the site to supplement the radio show itself.
The episodes cover several topics, mostly in current news and pop culture that is of interest to teens.
The series is well produced, attempting to be the equal of any adult-produced online series.
The show suffers from not being kept up to date, but the material that has already been produced is well made.

My High School Journalism. (2012). _The national edition_. Retrieved from <http://my.hsj.org/Schools/Newspaper/tabid/100/view/frontpage/newspaperid/856/Default.aspx>

This website collects teen-created news stories from around the country.
The overall site is used by high schools and young journalists throughout the nation, with their own individual sites, and the best stories are collected under the banner of _The National Edition_.
These news stories cover a variety of topics of interest to teens, some specific to the schools and local area, but some of national relevance as well.
It is an excellent resource to show what teens can create, which will be interesting to teens and can encourage then to create content themselves.
It also is kept current and up-to-date, making it more useful and timely than Youth Radio is able to be.
