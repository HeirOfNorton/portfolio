title: Non-book Cataloging at Ramsey County Libraries
...

Introduction
------------

For my exploration of non-book cataloging, I used the example of the Ramsey County library system.
This is a large public library system with a total of seven branches throughout Ramsey County, Minnesota.
It can be visited online at <www.rclreads.org>.
I spoke to Nicole Herald, the Technical Services Manager of the library system.
I also visited the Roseville branch in Roseville Minnesota, the largest branch of the library system.
The Roseville branch has a non-book collection of about 65,000 items, including multiple copies of a total of 44,000 individual titles.


Types of Non-book Materials
---------------------------

The Roseville library includes several types of non-book items, though fewer than it used to carry.
Currently, the largest number of non-book items is in the DVD collection, which includes over 15,800 films, television series, and nonfiction documentaries, not counting multiple copies of popular titles.
The library also has over 15,000 music CDs in a variety of genres.
It carries over 13,000 audiobooks on CD, both fiction and nonfiction.
It has about 300 video games for XBox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii.
Finally, the only kind of realia available for checkout are Power Check Meters, used to check appliances for their power consumption.

The Ramsey County libraries used to carry art pieces for checkout, but discontinued that program a few years ago.
More recently, they had Museum Passes, which could be checked out from the library to be used for free admission to local museums, but these were funded by an outside agency who has withdrawn support, ending the program.
Neither type of item remains in the library's catalog system.

How Cataloged
-------------

All non-book items at the Roseville library have complete catalog records.
There is very little original cataloging done, nearly everything can be copy cataloged.
The one main exception is the Power Check Meter, but all new "copies" of the meter are the same, so the cataloging has already been done for that item.
The other non-book items, the DVDs and video games especially, still present challenges to cataloging.
Often multiple sources need to be consulted due to the rarity of complete catalog records for every title in any one library system.

Non-book items as a whole do not have a very large backlog, little more than the main book collection.
Individually, the backlog is mostly made up of audiobooks and DVD documentaries; current movies and music CDs receive a higher priority due to their popularity, and the fact that new releases of DVDs are circulated as "rental" DVDs, so they bring in some revenue to the library.

Call Numbers
------------

Non-book items are classified and receive call numbers in the same way as the book collection, for better of worse.
Call numbers are used as a kind of "road map" to find an items, less than as a true classification.
Non-book materials will then have a line giving the format: DVD for any DVD videorecording, regardless of genre; CD for music CDs; TB/CD for audiobooks; and XBOX, WII, or PS3 for video games.
Nonfiction DVDs and audiobooks are then classified using Dewey Decimal Classification, as are music CDs.
Nonfiction audiobooks include a Cutter number.
Fiction DVDs and audiobooks do not have a classification number, but instead simply have FIC in the same place.
The call number is completed with the first four letters of the catalog main entry, the author for fiction audiobooks, main performer or composer for music CDs, and title for all others except for nonfiction audiobooks, which as mentioned have a Cutter number.
The Power check meters are not classified and do not have a call number.

Some examples:
*   Back in black \[sound recording\] / AC/DC --- **CD 781.7 AC.DC**
*   Toy story \[videorecording\] --- **DVD J FIC TOY**
*   Shoah \[videorecording\] --- **DVD 940.5318 SHOA**
*   The Shining \[sound recording\] / by Stephen King --- **TB/CD FIC KING**
*   Running with scissors \[sound recording\] : a memoir / by Augusten Burroughs --- **TB/CD 813.6 B97R**
*   Final fantasy crystal chronicles \[Wii video game\] --- **GAMES WII FINA**

Music Sound Recordings
----------------------

As stated above, music CDs are classified using Dewey Decimal Classification numbers.
This is not perfectly used; as an example, the CD listed above for _Back in Black_ by AC/DC would properly be classified as popular music or Rock and Roll, but the classification number assigned is listed in most sources as the number for Sacred music.
Music CDs use as a book number the first four letters of the main performer or composer, rather than a standard Cutter number, in order to keep them easier to browse for patrons.

The call numbers do not help much when trying to find an item, though this may be more a problem with the shelving method than the call numbers themselves.
The shelves are sorted into broad genres of music, roughly corresponding to the DDC numbers, and are then alphabetized by composer or performer.
However, the numbers and composer/performer names are kept so brief that they do little to distinguish different items.
It is very common for two unrelated items to have the same call number, simply because the composers have names that begin with the same four letters.
Because of this, it is usually easier to search for a specific artist without bothering with the call number, as long as you know the genre where that artist would be placed.

Packaging Items
---------------

Nearly all of the non-book items are put into uniform packaging.
Music CDs are normally left in their original jewel cases.
DVDs are placed into standard generic plastic cases with the original cover art trimmed and placed inside as well.
Audiobooks are put into uniform sized clamshell cases with CD sleeves inside, again with the original cover art trimmed and placed in the case.

All library items are "tattle"-taped with magnetic strips that will set off the door alarm if not deactivated.
All items are also RFID tagged.
No other anti-theft devices are used in the packaging, though the remnants of older and no longer used systems remain on some of the packaging.

Shelving Non-books
------------------

All non-book items are shelved separately from the book collections, and are separated by format.
Audiobooks are shelved on the same bookshelves as the books collections, with the spines out to read the titles, and are simply kept on different shelves than the print books.
Fiction movie DVDs, television DVDs, and Documentary DVDs are kept separate from one another, as are music CDs, but they are all shelved in the same way.
They are in front-facing rows, keeping covers visible, with plastic dividers between items that have different performers or different first letters of their titles.
Patrons must flip through the visible titles to see additional titles behind them.

Problems
--------

The library has needed to balance the problems involved with non-book items with an ever decreasing budget that will not allow for full solutions to every challenge.
One way has been to process non-book items in batches.
Since non-book items require more processing and repackaging, they are often held until a sizable number can be done at once, using the principles of a factory line to repackage many items as quickly as possible.

Problems resulting from damage and degradation have been reduced since moving toward almost entirely disk-based media.
CDs and DVDs are more robust, in general, than the magnetic tapes that were once the standard.
Disk resurfacers are kept at each library to remove scratches as needed, keeping disks usable as long as possible.

Costs have also been reduced in the area of theft prevention.
The library once utilized a greater number of anti-theft mechanisms.
DVD cases were locked, and needed to be unlocked at the circulation desk.
Music CDs and audiobooks had their disks kept in drawers at the circulation desk as well, with only empty cases kept on the shelves.
It was determined that the costs associated with these deterrents was too high compared to the amount saved in reduced theft, especially since theft was not really reduces very much.
These mechanisms have since been removed, leaving only the same anti-theft devices as are used with the printed book collection.
Losses from theft are evaluated each year to decide if any of them should be implemented again, but so far the costs remain too high for the benefits.

Conclusion
----------

On the whole, I think that the Ramsey County libraries handle their non-book items adequately, but there is much room for improvement.
The cataloging of non-book items is beyond reproach, as every item is fully cataloged with as much detail as anyone is likely to need.
The classification for most items is minimal, but would be enough in most circumstances to find an item without trouble.
The audiobooks show this, as they are shelved in the same manner as the print books, and are just as easy to find.

DVDs and music CDs are much more difficult to navigate, but this is a problem of the shelving more than of the classification of the items themselves.
All of these items are shelved in such a way that only a few are visible in front, with several items hidden behind them.
If one is lucky, the hidden items will be in alphabetical order, but as often as not they are only haphazardly shelved together by the first letter of their titles or artists, and not sorted any better.
Again, though, this is the fault of the shelving chosen, not of the classification scheme itself.

If the items were shelved so that the call numbers of all items were visible at once, it would be much easier to find something.
At that point, the collection is now large enough that more detailed call numbers might be needed.
As stated, right now there are many items that have the same call number simply their titles or performers begin with the same four letters.
This is not currently a problem simply because the call numbers are usually not visible enough to use for finding an item, and if they were to become visible they would quickly show themselves to be too short to be usable.

The other suggestion I would have that might help to find an item would be to separate into more detailed genres and styles.
Music could be classified with ANSCR or another scheme, as could the movie and television DVDs.
Either way, this would be familiar to patrons who are used to items like this being separated into well-defined genres from their experiences in music and movie retail stores.
If we want to make things easiest for our patrons, we would do well to look to the examples set by retailers who only stay in business if their customers can find what they want.
For the Roseville library, this and improving the shelving decisions would go a long way toward making their non-book collection easier to browse and to search.
