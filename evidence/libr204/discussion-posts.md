##Week 2: Library Website##

The Ramsey County public library system uses its website (www.rclreads.org) to position itself as a modern library system ready to help all of its patrons. Evans and Ward describe how informaion services must market themselves based on users' needs (2007, p.84) and this website responds to this challenge by emphasizing several services they offer for many different types of patrons. Such services as downloadable eBooks, help for homework and job hunting, and couseling for small business owners are highlighted on a slideshow on the front page, with additional services lower on the page and in menus at the top. They also target multiple segments of the population, including students doing research or casual readers who only want the latest bestseller.

The library showcases many different services, but could do a better job of selling those services. Two important reasons that people may not use a library's services, as described by Evans and Ward, are that they do not know about the services or they do not think they need those services (p. 85). The library webpage showcases available services, but does nothing to try to convince readers why they need them. Services are simply presented as being there, assuming that everyone will know if they need them or not. The library could better serve its patrons if it made more effort to show the value of all of its services, so people could take advantage of them when they did not realize they should before.

##Week 9: Budget##

When reducing the budget for a Public Library, it is important not to panic and start slashing funding for programs left and right. Though hard decisions msut be made, they must always be made with the goal being to keep service as high as possible. To that end, the first job when finding places to cut is to thoroughly evaluate all of the services and programs that are offered by the library. Evans and Ward (2007) give several strategies for evaluating the efficiency and the success of services. Each program must be looked at closely to see if they are making good use of the budget, prioritizing those services that offer the greatest worth to the community. Programs that are little used, or that do not offer a high worth to the community, may be the easiest to reduce or eliminate without compromising the overall level of service.

For those services that are kept, it is important for them to be handled with as much efficiency as possible, again without compromising service. Berry (2009) describes some of the steps taken by the Queens public library, a system that serves enormous numbers of people and is often underfunded and understaffed. One strategy employed is to offer more direct one-on-one service for more people by automating parts that do not require individual attention, such as book check-out. This way, more librarians and staff are able to circulate among the patrons and are not tied to the chack-out desk. Other, similar initiatives can be used so that the quality of service can be kept high, even as the quantity of services must flatten or reduce.

Cutting programs and making them more efficient is only half the battle. When funding is cut, sometimes the most effective response is to find additional sources of funding. Pearson (2009) describes the need for marketing and advocacy for public libraries, and gives some strategies for courting private donors. He points out that, in tight economic times, individual donations to libraries usually stay just as high even as government and corporate funding are cut. Our hypothetical public library would form a marketing team who will get the word out that the library is still, that its services are more needed than ever, and that help is needed.

Evans and Ward (2007) also point out the rise of Responsibility and Profit centers. Our library will open a section of the building for enhancing revenue within the library itself, by selling used books from donations or remainders, selling souvineers and memorabilia for the library and community, and selling prints and other pieces by local artists and craftspeople. The library should aim for reducing dependency on the main budget by about five percent per initiative, so that the store adds 5% to the revenue, 5% of the budget is removed by reducing or eliminating unused services, and so on. By combining several approaches, and only needing a relatively small amount of the budget accounted for by each one, any one initiative can underperform and have the slack taken up by the other three. This will make it easier to maintain service at a consistantly high level for our patrons without drastically cutting services or giving too much of our time over to seeking sales or donations.

##Week 10: Technology##

One of the most exciting technologies being developed id the field of Augmented Reality. I think this will have a major impact on information science, simply because it put more information at the fingertips of people looking for it. Benkoil (2009) describes several ways that AR is already being used to supplement the world, and more way it will continue to do so. There has been a growing trend for years of combining and cross-referencing information, seen in user-edited wikis and social linking sites like del.icio.us and Slashdot. As technology brings that trend outside of the desktop and puts in the world in front of us. Why look for reviews of a restaurant online when you can look at a restaurant through your smart phone and get the reviews right in front of you? This trend has started with relatively simple and fun stuff, but it will continue with more serious endeavors. Benkoil imagines AR being integrated with news stories, connecting locations witht he events that have happened there. It will go further, not only with events, but also comments about the location, and videos taken at that location. It will also affect book sand libraries, by connecting books to locations, by annotating books and offering commentary, by breaking down the bariers between different media and the world the represent. Computers and the internet have connected information, but with AR almost everything can be connected the same way.
