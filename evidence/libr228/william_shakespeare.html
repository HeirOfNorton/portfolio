						<div style="display:block;"><div class="titlerow" style="margin-bottom:10px;">Welcome to the William Shakespeare LibGuide</div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>Welcome everyone to this beginner’s introduction to researching William Shakespeare and his works. This research guide has been created for anyone who is new to the Bard and needs to know where to start.</p>
<p>This guide does not go into great depth, nor does it try to list every possible resource that could be used. Instead, it lists many of the most useful resources that are available on the broad topic of Shakespeare and his works, along with a few pointers for how to continue your research when you need to go beyond what is listed here.</p>
<p>This guide is intended for students who may have done literary or scholarly research in the past, but have never needed to approach Shakespeare before. It should be appropriate for High School or early college students, or anyone who simply wishes to gain a better understanding of Shakespeare.</p>

						<div style="display:block;"><div class="titlerow" style="margin-bottom:10px;">How to use this guide</div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>This guide is not intended to be read front-to-back. Rather, it has resources arranged in a few broad categories based on which aspect of Shakespeare research you are most interested in.</p>
<p>Many of the best resources available on or by William Shakespeare are in print as books. In this research guide, any books list will have a link to WorldCat to allow you to find them at your local library.</p>
<p>If you do not know where to start, I think it is always best to begin with the works themselves. The <strong>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works</strong> tab will lead you to the plays and poems written by William Shakespeare. This includes the text of the plays themselves, as well as links and pointers to good videos editions of the plays.</p>
<p>Once you have read or seen the play you are interested in, then it is time to find out more of the world surrounding the play so you can understand it better. <strong>Shakespeare in Context</strong> Includes resources on William Shakespeare&rsquo;s life and his world, so you can understand his writing in the context in which it was written. It also includes resources on Shakespeare&rsquo;s language, so that you can better understand the text itself.</p>
<p>After that, there is also the centuries of writing <em>about</em> Shakespeare that has come since. <strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong> gives direction on finding the resources that try to explain the writings themselves. It is a portal to get you started reading the immense amount of scholarship that has already been done on Shakespeare&rsquo;s works, helping you find and focus on the resources that you need.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the &ldquo;Just for Fun&rdquo; resource on each page, for when you need a break from all the stuffy scholarship.</p></div></div>

Fortunately, there is no shortage of ways to find and read the plays and poetry, as it is all public domain and readily available.</p>
<p>For casual reading, there is nothing wrong with a simple copy like you can find in the bargain bin at the local bookstore, or on any of several websites around the internet. For serious research, though, a good critical edition is vital. These editions, such as the <em>Riverside Shakespeare</em>, the <em>Arden Shakespeare</em>, or the <em>Bedford Shakespeare</em>, include very useful notes and annotations to help understand and appreciate the text more fully.</p>

If you only ever read one edition of Shakespeare’s works, this is the one you should choose.</li></ul></div>

						<div style="display:block;"><div class="titlerow" style="margin-bottom:10px;">Finding in the Catalog</div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>Here are some suggestions for find the works of Shakespeare in your local library.</p>
<h3>Call Numbers</h3>
<p>First, find out if your library uses Library of Congress classification or Dewey Decimal Classification. Then, especially if you are using a large university library, find out if the Humanities or Literature collections are in a specific branch or floor.</p>
<p>Once you are in the right place, the Shakespeare works should be in these call number ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library of Congress: <strong>PR2750-2875</strong></li>
<li>Dewey: <strong>822.33</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Catalog Searching<br /></strong></h3>
<p>To find all the works of Shakespeare in the library catalog, search for "Shakespeare, William" as the&nbsp;<strong>Author</strong>. If you search for Shakespeare under&nbsp;<strong>Subject</strong>, or just under&nbsp;<strong>Keyword</strong>, you will also pull up all materials&nbsp;<em>about</em> Shakespeare, which will be a very long list.</p></div></div>

						<div style="display:block;"><div class="titlerow" style="margin-bottom:10px;">Shakespeare on Screen</div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>It is important to remember that Shakespeare’s plays are <em>play’s</em>. They are meant to be seen and heard, not read. It is not always possible to get to the theatre to watch a performance live—though that is always the best—but there are several excellent plays on video and film adaptations. I highly recommend any plays produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and any films directed by Kenneth Branagh.</p>
</div><ul><li id="book3646199">Twelfth Night by Trevor Nunn<BR>Publication Date: 1996<BR><a name="book_3646199" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/twelfth-night/oclc/427413551">http://www.worldcat.org/title/twelfth-night/oclc/427413551</a>This beautiful version of Shakespeare’s best comedy plays well with the gender stereotypes and confusion that abounds in most of his comedies.

This has an all-star cast, keeps everything moving quickly, and includes many visual touches to help explain what is going on whenever the text gets confusing. Make sure you have a good chunk of time set aside, though; this film is four hours long, but it is never boring.</li><li id="book3646225">Richard III by Richard Loncraine<BR>Publication Date: 1995<BR><a name="book_3646225" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/richard-iii/oclc/163199563">http://www.worldcat.org/title/richard-iii/oclc/163199563</a>Sir Ian McKellen stars as the unrepentant villain in this film which updates the play to the 1930s, using the modern setting to help explain the complex relationships between the characters that can easily be missed by readers who are not familiar with English History.</li></ul></div>

						<div style="display:block;"><div class="titlerow" style="margin-bottom:10px;">Shakespeare's Language</div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>One of the most difficult aspects of reading and understanding Shakespeare is his language. Shakespeare wrote in Early Modern English, a language that is nearly the same as what we use today, but at the same time very different in many ways. Aside from words that are rarely used anymore and words that have changed meaning, Shakespeare was also a poet who included a great deal of metaphor and allusion in his writing.</p>
<p>For any beginner to Shakespeare it is vital to have a well-annotated edition of the text that explains these changes in language and references.</p>

It is a portal with links to introductions to Elizabethan grammar, dictionaries of changed or lost words, and explanations of pronunciation and puns. With this reference, you will finally know what a bodkin is!</li><li id="book3646317">Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare by Isaac Asimov<BR>ISBN: 0517268256<BR>Publication Date: 2003-09-02<BR><a name="book_3646317" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/asimovs-guide-to-shakespeare/oclc/4498736">http://www.worldcat.org/title/asimovs-guide-to-shakespeare/oclc/4498736</a>This hefty tome by Isaac Asimov is a thorough explanation of the context, references, and allusions in Shakespeare’s plays. Dr. Asimov goes through each play systematically and explains the historical and geographic context of each play (so you can learn where Bohemia is, or when <em>Hamlet</em> is supposed to have happened). He also goes through each reference or allusion to history or mythology and explains them, so that Shakespeare’s drawn out metaphors will finally make sense.</li><li id="book3646319">The Oxford English Dictionary<BR><a name="book_3646319" href="http://www.oed.com/">http://www.oed.com/</a>Absolutely the most accepted authority on the meaning and history of every word in the English language. If you find a word you cannot understand, this will explain it in exhaustive detail, including every meaning it has ever had and the history behind its usage. An interesting note is that the OED credits Shakespeare as the inventor (or at least the first person to use in print) nearly 3,000 words, many of them now in common usage today. Note that the OED Online is by subscription, you must access it through your library or find a copy nearby.</li></ul></div>

In particular, be sure to search for <em>specific</em> topics (such as the play being discussed, the literary theory/approach being used, particular characters or themes) and not just for “Shakespeare”, or you will find yourself with tens of thousands of articles and nothing to distinguish them.</p>
