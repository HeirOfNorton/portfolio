An Educational film
-------------------

**Narrator:**
:   Welcome to the Mallville Public Library.
    Meet Andrea, Mallville's newest reference librarian, fresh out of Library School.
    She knows her sources and is ready to face the public.

    She joins a staff that already has two veteran reference librarians.
    There is Colleen, who has been a reference librarian for over thirty years.
    Colleen is a little set in her ways, and will only use a computer if she absolutely has to.
    There is also Dewey.
    Unlike Colleen, Dewey loves computers and the internet, but he always wants patrons to find as much as they can on their own.

    Let's join these three during a typical busy day, to see how they handle different kinds of reference questions.

###First Patron###

_A confused young man approaches the reference desk._

**Patron:**
:   Excuse me?

**Colleen:**
:   Yes? Can I help you?

**Patron:**
:   I'm trying to find out something.
    What is the origin of the word "poptastic"?

**Colleen:**
:   Well, for a word origin,you have to go to a good dictionary.
    Here's the American Heritage Dictionary, it's pretty good.
    Hmm, it doesn't have an entry for "poptastic," though.
    Let's go to the Oxford English Dictionary.
    If it's not in there, than it's not a real word.
    Okay, here it is.
    "Poptastic."
    Meaning a very good recording or performance of pop music.
    Well that makes sense.
    According to the OED, poptastic was first used on the British TV show _Harry Enfield's Television Programme_ as a catchphrase of spoof radio disc jockeys.
    It was then used used by the _Evening Standard_ in 1992, and the _Daily Telegraph_ in 1994, using the current meaning.
    So that's where it comes from.

**Patron:**
:   Okay, thanks.

**Narrator:**
:   Well, that seems to have gone all right.
    Colleen answered the question, even giving dates and examples, but the patron still seems disappointed.
    Let's see if it goes any differently for the new librarian, Andrea.

**Andrea:**
:   Excuse me.
    You look a little frustrated.
    May I help you find something?

**Patron:**
:   I don't know.
    I was trying to find the origin of the word "poptastic," but that didn't help very much.

**Andrea:**
:   Poptastic?
    That's a fun sounding word.
    It could come from a few different places though.
    Why are you looking for it?

**Patron:**
:   I heard about poptastic music, and I wanted to try it out.

**Andrea:**
:   Hmm.
    I've never heard of poptastic music before.
    Where did you hear about it?
    How was it used?

**Patron:**
:   Someone on the bus was listening to music.
    It sounded kind of weird, but cool.
    I asked him what he was listening to, and he said it was poptastic.

**Andrea:**
:   He said the music was poptastic?

**Patron:**
:   Yes, that's how he put it.
    He said he was listening to poptastic.

**Andrea:**
    Well, that sounds like poptastic is a specific kind of music.
    Let's take a look.
    Here, our library subscribes to the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, so let's start there.
    Hmm, the only entry is a book about Cheap Trick published by Poptastic Books.

**Patron:**
:   No, it definitely wasn't Cheap Trick.

**Andrea:**
    It's okay.
    We won't give up there.
    We'll try the Music Index Online, it's a collection of articles about music.
    Maybe someone has written about it.
    No, just that book again, and a book review of another book titled Poptastic.

**Patron:**
:   I'm not sure there's any such thing as poptastic, anymore.

**Andrea:**
:   You're sure he said the music itself was poptastic?
    He wasn't just saying it was great, or something?

**Patron:**
:   It didn't sound like that.
    He said "I'm listening to poptastic."

**Andrea:**
:   Maybe poptastic is the name of the music.
    Our library doesn't have all the newest stuff, but let's look online someplace that has a bigger collection.
    Here, we'll search Amazon.com.
    Let's see what we get if we search for "poptastic" in the music category.

**Patron:**
:   That first one is just a bunch of pop songs.
    Hey, what about that fourth one.
    That could be it.
    It's a band called Poptastic!
    Yeah, I think that's it.
    The way it's described sounds like the music I heard.

**Andrea:**
:   See, you just have to be persistent.
    Now you can buy the CD, or find it on iTunes.
    Or we can search through WorldCat to see if another library has it, and I can get it through Interlibrary Loan.

**Patron:**
:   Thanks, this is just what I needed.

**Andrea:**
:   Great!
    And please, don't hesitate to ask if you need anything else.

**Narrator:**
:   Thank you, Andrea.
    She has shown that you always need to ask questions to make sure you know what your patron really needs, and that it can take persistence to find the right answer if it is not located in the obvious places.
    Here comes another patron, now.
    I wonder what his question will be.

###Second Patron###

**Patron:**
:   Excuse me.

**Dewey:**
:   Yeah, what's up?

**Patron:**
:   I need help finding something.
    What associations are headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan?

**Dewey:**
:   have you looked anywhere, yet?

**Patron:**
:   I didn't know where to start.

**Dewey:**
:   Fine.
    My Google-fu will show you the right path.
    Here, I just did a simple search for "dearborn Michigan association headquarters".

**Patron:**
:   That seems like a lot, and most of those aren't what I'm looking for.

**Dewey:**
:   Well, you'll just have to look through them.
    Whatever you need is bound to be in there somewhere.
    Maybe at the Dearborn Chamber of Commerce.
    I don't know.

**Narrator:**
:   I think maybe Dewey gave his patron a little too much to work with.
    But now Andrea is approaching him.
    Perhaps she will have some different ideas.

**Andrea:**
:   Hello.
    Are you finding what you need today?

**Patron:**
:   Heck, no.
    I can't find anything I need.

**Andrea:**
:   What are you looking for?

**Patron:**
:   I need to find what associations are headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan.

**Andrea:**
:   That sounds pretty important.
    Maybe it would help to narrow that down a little.
    What kind of associations are you looking for, in particular?
    Trade associations, non-profits, or something else?

**Patron:**
:   Oh, uh, non-profits, I guess.

**Andrea:**
:   Well, that's a start.
    Why do you need to find them, and why in Dearborn, if you don't mind my asking?

**Patron:**
:   Nah, I don't mind.
    I'm moving to Dearborn in a couple months, and I want to get an idea about the place.
    See what they have to offer.
    I'm always interested in giving back.

**Andrea:**
:   That sounds exciting!
    Well, to get the non-profits that are headquartered there, your best bet is probably Headquarters USA.
    Our library has a copy in the reference section.
    The IRS also keeps a list of non-profit organizations on their website, I can show you, and you can search it by location.
    It's called the Exempt Organization Select Check.
    From the sound of things, though, you might not want to just find organizations that are headquartered there.
    You might want ones that operate there, too, even if their headquarters are somewhere else.
    If so, we can pull up the yellow pages online for Dearborn and see what they have listed locally.

**Patron:**
:   I might take you up on that, later, but for now I think I'll just go with that Headquarters book.

**Andrea:**
:   Okay, here you go.
    Just ask if you have any more questions.

**Narrator:**
:   The patron seems satisfied, and Andrea could have just left it at that, but she knows better.

**Andrea:**
:   Hi, again.
    Is that directory helping you find what you need?
    Do you need any more help?

**Patron:**
:   Yeah, I got another question.
    I have a bunch of phone numbers and addresses, but I'm not sure what to do with them.
    I want to learn more about the places, and I was looking to see what would be a good one to volunteer with.

**Andrea:**
:   Okay.
    Most of those almost certainly have their own web pages, so we can start there.
    That will tell you what each organization stands for, and what their goals are.
    They will probably have any current volunteer opportunities listed, as well.
    If you want to volunteer, though, you could also search for a volunteer opportunity directly.
    [Serve.gov](www.serve.gov) and [VolunteerMatch.org](www.wolunteermatch.org) are two websites that list current volunteer opportunities, usually with non-profit organizations, and they both let you search by location.

**Patron:**
:   That sounds good, too.

**Andrea:**
:   Okay, so let's start with this one...

**Narrator:**
:   Andrea helped her patron search through the different sites for another fifteen minutes, to make sure he found one he liked.
    She showed that it is important to understand the purpose of the question, if you want to answer it correctly, and that you should not rely on the internet alone.
    She also showed that it is important to come back to your patrons later to follow up with them, and make sure they are finding what they need.

    I think we have time for one more patron, today.

###Third Patron###

**Patron:**
:   He-hello.
    Excuse me.

**Colleen:**
:   Yes, what do you need?

**Patron:**
:   Um, I need help finding some law information.
    Where can I get a summary of divorce law in various US states?

**Colleen:**
:   Divorce law?
    Honey, you shouldn't be looking for divorce law.

**Patron:**
:   What?
    But, I---

**Colleen:**
:   There are other options, you know.
    Here, I've got a directory of marriage counselors.

**Patron:**
:   I don't need that---

**Colleen:**
:   Or maybe you just need to put the spice back in it?

**Patron:**
:   That's it!
    Just forget it!

**Narrator:**
:   Uh oh.
    Looks like Colleen might have let her own assumptions and beliefs get in the way of helping her patron.
    But our patron isn't giving up yet.
    Maybe she'll have better luck with Dewey.

**Patron:**
:   Excuse me.

**Dewey:**
:   Hey, what can I do for you?

**Patron:**
:   Where can I get a summary of divorce law in various US states?

**Dewey:**
:   Cutting the old ball and chain, huh?
    Can't say I blame you, this day and age.

**Patron:**
:   ...You, too, huh?
    What is it with this library?

**Dewey:**
:   No problem, we've got lots of resources to help.
    Hey, Mel!

**Mel (from the back office):**
:   What is it, Dewey?

**Dewey:**
:   We still have that law database subscription?!

**Patron:**
:   Shhh!

**Dewey:**
:   I have a lady here who wants to be single again!

**Patron:**
:   Eep!

**Dewey:**
:   So anyway---hey, you're turning red!

**Patron:**
:   I have to go!

**Narrator:**
:   Strike two!
    Dewey needs to learn how to be a little more discrete with his patrons, especially when they are looking for information that may be sensitive or embarrassing.
    Fortunately our patron is very persistent.
    Let's hope that the third time is the charm.

**Patron:**
:   Excuse me.

**Andrea:**
:   Good afternoon.
    Can I help you find something?

**Patron:**
:   I don't know anymore.
    I think everyone here is crazy.

**Andrea:**
:   Tell me about it.
    I have to work with them all day.

**Patron:**
:   I guess it can't hurt to ask one more time.
    Where can I get a summary of divorce law in various US states?

**Andrea:**
:   There's a couple places we can look, depending on how much detail you need.
    May I ask why you need the information?

**Patron:**
:   Well, it's kind of embarrassing...

**Andrea:**
:   I understand.
    First, let me assure you that our library has a very strict policy on confidentiality.
    I promise that nothing you ask me will be repeated to anyone else.
    I am only asking to try to answer your question better.

**Patron:**
:   No, it's okay.
    I made a bet with my cousin that there are still states where you can't get a divorce unless someone was cheating, and she says that you can get a divorce whenever you want in all of the states.
    If I'm wrong, I have to wear a mini skirt with go-go boots all month.
    I just want to check.

**Andrea:**
:   That sounds easy enough.
    I think the best place to start would be [FindLaw](www.findlaw.com).
    It has pages for divorce law in each of the fifty states.
    You may not need to get that far, though.
    I see here that it has a page specifically on Fault and No-Fault divorce.

**Patron:**
:   Oh, that's it.

**Andrea:**
:   Sorry to tell you, but according to this all states allow No-Fault divorce, although some require the spouses to live apart for a certain amount of time before they can get a divorce.

**Patron:**
:   Oh.
    I guess I better get used to go-go boots.

**Andrea:**
:   Does that answer your question, or did you need more?

**Patron:**
:   Well, I suppose I could make my cousin work for, and get the real laws from all the states.
    Can she do that?

**Andrea:**
:   With enough work, she can.
    FindLaw has links to the most relevant laws from each page and for each state.
    If she needed more than that, our library has a subscription to Lexis/Nexis.
    That would allow her to search through thousands of laws and court decisions to get as much support as she needs.

**Patron:**
:   Wow, you could almost run a court case from here.

**Andrea:**
:   It wouldn't be the first time.
    For any real legal matter, though, I would have to recommend consulting a practicing lawyer who would know more about current laws and how they can be applied to a specific situation.

**Patron:**
:   My cousin will be happy.
    Thanks, anyway.

**Andrea:**
:   Anytime!
    Come back again if you have any other questions.

**Narrator:**
:   Much better!
    Andrea shows that you must always respect the confidentiality of your patrons.
    It won't always be needed, but they will appreciate it either way.
    She also demonstrates that you must never make assumptions about what the patron needs, and you must never let your own beliefs get in the way of helping them.
    Andrea didn't say so, but she believes that go-go boots are a crime against fashion, and if she had her choice she would never do anything to encourage anyone to wear them.
    Andrea kept this to herself, however, and helped her patron find the most correct information that she could for her situation.

    Well, I hope we have given you an idea about how best to help your patrons, as well as how _not_ to help your patrons.
    Until next time!
