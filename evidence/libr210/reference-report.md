For this exercise, I also decided to ask the same question of two different libraries, so that I could compare different responses.
I chose the library systems that are core to the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.
The Ramsey County library system is based out of north Saint Paul and the surrounding suburbs.
Their email reference form is located at <http://www.rclreads.org/services/ask-librarian>.
The Hennepin County library system is based out of Minneapolis, and their form is at <http://www.hclib.org/pub/search/RefForm.cfm>.

To begin with, both libraries have nearly identical forms for their "Ask a Librarian" service.
This form is minimal, asking for email address, optionally a library card number, and then giving a large text box for the question itself.
Ross, Nilsen, and Radford (2009) emphasize the need for a well thought-out and detailed form for email reference questions.
After all, over email it is nearly impossible to conduct a proper reference interview, and a good form can serve much of the same purpose.
It allows the librarian to narrow the search, and figure out how much and how little information is needed, even whay type of information is needed.
An example of a good form, from www.ipl.org, includes a drop down menu for the general subject, space to describe how the answer will be used, whether or not it is for school, and a space to indicate any sources already consulted.
By leaving out these options, and only having a space for the question itself, both libraries start out already weaker than they could be before the question is even asked.

The question I asked is as follows:

>   I am trying to find any kind of literature I can featuring crows or other corvid birds prominently.
>   Any novels, stories, or poetry, classic or modern, that have crows in them.
>   Other corvids like ravens or magpies, too.
>   Can you tell me of any, or a good way to find more?

This question really has two parts that I was hoping to be answered.
The first is asking for a reader advisory, looking for suggestions of reading material related to the subject.
The second is more research based, looking for direction in how to search for more on my own.

For the reader advisory, I was rather disappointed.
Neither librarian that responded offered any suggestions directly.
The librarian from Ramsey County, for starters, did not appear to read the question fully.
She said she was not sure if I wanted fiction or nonfiction, however the question specifically asks for novels and stories, which would generally be fiction.
Both went straight into ways for me to search myself, though.
Each only mentioned one specific work by name, oddly enough the same one: Poe's "The Raven," but it was only mentioned as an example, not as a suggestion.

The librarian from Ramsey County then went into ways to search her library's online catalog.
She listed possible keyword searches that could help find books on the subject, including using additional keywords like "fiction" or "easy" to narrow the results to novels or children's book, respectively.
And that's it.
She did not elaborate any further in the possible holdings of her library, or ways to search beyond the library itself.
She simply stopped at that point, and asked me to email again if I needed more help.
It felt like the online equivalent of telling me where that section of the stacks were and moving me on my way.

The librarian from Hennepin County gave a much more thorough account of ways I could find what I needed.
For one thing, she seemed more knowledgeable about how the online catalog worked and was indexed.
Rather than a blind keyword search, she suggested using the controlled subject headings to be sure I found relevant information.
She then followed this with a statement that she would be sending a link with the results of a subject search for "corvidae."
I never received a link, a mistake on her part, but it would simple enough to repeat the search myself as she described it.

She then went beyond the base library collection, and suggested further ways to research literature on the topic.
In particular she suggested several databases available through her library that index poetry and fiction, as well as literary criticism and analysis which would likely reference useful sources.
It would have been nice if she included links to these databases, but it might not have been possible considering the subscription and proxy needs for accessing them.

All in all, the librarian from Hennepin county was much more thorough and helpful, but both could have been improved.
I felt much more encouraged by her response, and would be much more willing to ask for help from them again.
Since I did ask for suggestions for novels or stories, a brief reader advisory would have been appreciated, even if only to list the most popular titles that come up from their own catalog search.
Both libraries could also benefit from a more detailed question form, to help do some of the work of a reference interview and help them answer questions correctly the first time instead of needing to assume too much.
