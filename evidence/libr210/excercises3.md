title: Reference Exercise #3
...


This week I did not do a full playscript for the adventures of our intrepid librarians on the job. Dewey and Colleen had to go back to their own library. However, I have found that writing in something of a script format has helped me organize my thoughts and visualize how to conduct a reference interview, so I have kept that aspect, at least. Without further ado...

## 1) "What are some useful commentaries for a layman interested in Bible study?"

Librarian
:   "Oh, that's a good question. There are many different commentaries out there, so let's see what would work best for you. First of all, may I ask why you're looking for a commentary? Is it for a class, or anything?"

Patron
:   "No, not for class. I just want to understand the Bible a bit better."

Librarian
:   "Okay. Are you looking for a specific type of commentary? Like something that puts the events of the Bible into historical context, or one that explains the symbolism?"

Patron
:   "Hmm. Either of those could be interesting. I don't know, I just want to understand it better."

Librarian
:   "All right, let's get started. Here, let me pull something up on the computer. There really isn't an easy way to just pull up a list of commentaries, so let's start with the catalog. We do have 'Bible -- Commentaries' as a subject heading. WorldCat uses the same subject headings, too, and they have a lot more books listed. I can see here the Oxford Bible Commentary, the New Interpreter's Bible commentaries, the Expositor's Bible commentary. Do any of those sound interesting?"

Patron
:   "I'm not sure. Mabe if I could get a look at them..."

Librarian
:   "No problem, we have several of them here at our location. Here, let me show you. Those are on this shelf right over here."

***

Librarian
:   "Hello, again. Sorry I had to run off to help another patron. Do any of those look like something that will work for you?"

Patron
:   "I'm not sure. There are some pretty big books of commentary, here, and I can't tell if any of them are any good."

Librarian
:   Well, maybe we should get more opinions. Let me help you grab those and come back to the computer. We can pull up some reviews about those books, to see what other people think of them. WorldCat has some text reviews, mostly from regular readers who just write whether or not they enjoyed them. Oh, ATLA might work better. It's a database of articles about religion. If we search for book reviews and those titles, we should be able to pull up some full reviews by people more knowledgable in the field. They'll also describe the books in more detail, so you can get an idea of the approach it uses, and what strengths and weaknesses it has."

Patron
:   "Okay, let's try that ATLA thing, see what other people say about these things."

## 2) "After watching 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' I've decided to write a report on Audrey Hepburn for my class report. Where can I get some information about her life?"

Librarian
:   "Oh, I love that movie. I'm sure I can help you with that. First of all, you said it was for a class report. Do you have a copy of the assignment with you, so we can be sure we get what you need?"

Patron
:   "Umm, not on me, but I remember what it says. We have to write a ten page essay about a celebrity, including stuff about their life."

Librarian
:   "Okay. Well, we can certainly start with that. For just basic information you can use a good encyclopedia, or even Wikipedia. Or you can look her up in the Oxford Dictionay of National Biography, we have a copy in our reference section. You can get quite a bit of biographical information, but those will usually just skim the surface."

Patron
:   "Anything, uh, bigger?"

Librarian
:   "Oh, I'm sure. If we check the catalog, here, it looks like we have about a dozen biographies in our collection about Audrey Hepburn. I can show you where those are."

Patron
:   "Oh, my teacher said something about Primary Sources. Will those biographies work for that?"

Librarian
:   "Oh, maybe not. For that, you would usually try to get something written by the person themself. Hmm. It doesn't look like she ever wrote an autobiography, at least nothing I can find. Oh, but I'm sure she spoke to people a lot. She must have given interviews. Here, while we're at the computer, let me pull up the Historical Newspapers index. Most news indexes we have online don't go back far enough; after all, she died in 1993. Anyway, we can search this to find any interviews she gave to newspapers, see we can find things in her own words. That should world as a primary source, if we find anything relevant."

Patron
:   "Okay, great! I'll start reading through these."

Librarian
:   "Be sure to ask me if you need help finding anything else."


## 3) "The Simpson Family from the popular TV show lives in Springfield. Where exactly is that?"

Librarian
:   "Oh, good question. I used to watch the Simpsons all the time. May I ask why you're looking? Is it for a class, or something?"

Patron
:   "Nah, I just need to settle a bet with my buddy about it."

Librarian
:   "Okay, sounds simple enough. One place we can start is with City Profiles USA, or with the U.S. Census Bureau's gazetteer. See if it has a Springfield listed."

Patron
:   "That's ... a lot of Springfields."

Librarian
:   "Yeah, I had no idea there were that many Springfields in the United States. Okay, that means we'll have to get more specific. We need to see if there is any information about which Springfield, exactly, the Simpsons is set in."

Patron
:   "How do we do that?"

Librarian
:   "Let's start with information about the show itself. We can look for Wikis or other websites that have information. Wikipedia probably has some information, or we can see if there's a wiki about the show itself, although that would probably be fan-run and not very authoritative."

Patron
:   "Well, we can start there, but I don't think my buddy will accept Wikipedia as a final authority."

Librarian
:   "Okay, let's see. Wikipedia actually has an article about Springfield in the Simpsons. Oh, it says that Springfield is not supposed to be any specific city."

Patron
:   "It's not?"

Librarian
:   "No. It was based on Portland, Oregon, and Springfield, Massachussets, and was actually names after Springfield, Oregon, but it was made so that it could stand in for any small city in the country, and a lot of the details make it impossible for it to exist in the real world."

Patron
:   "Oh. But I can't just use Wikipedia as my source for that."

Librarian
:   "Well, the article cites its sources for those statements. Mostly from newspaper interviews, or from DVD commentaries. Here, let's write these down. We can then go into one of our newspaper indexes like ProQuest Newsstand and get the original articles. Straight from the creator's mouth, so to speak."

Patron
:   "Okay, I guess that would have to work. I still don't think I'm gonna win the bet."

Librarian
:   "Well, I'll help you pull up what I can. Let me know if there is any other way I can help."
