1.  I would first double check to be sure I understood the question fully.
    It would seem a simple question, basically if a bibliography of works about partridges exists or not, but I would not want to assume.
    I would first be certain he meant a bibliography of nonfiction works.
    I would also ask if he meant books only about partridges, or if more general books about, for example, quail would count as well.

    If the library has a copy or access, a good source would be the _World Bibliography of Bibliographies_, as well as the _Bibliographic Index_.
    If such a bibliography was published within the time periods covered by these resources, then they should be found.

    Another source, one simpler to start with, would be to check the catalog of the local library or another, larger one.
    Both the King Library and the Library of Congress have "Partridges -- Bibliography" as a subject heading.
    These reveal _Quails and partridges of North America; a bibliography_ by Charles Crispens (1960) as the main item.
    The King Library also has two brief volumes of _Raising quail, partridge, pheasant, bobwhites, and ostriches_ by Jean A. Larson, the first covering 1979-1989, and the second covering 1987-1991.
    The Library of Congress also has _Hungarian Partridge Bibliography_ by Keith Trego and Ted Upgren (1975).

    These sources show that there have been partridge bibliographies, but nothing recent.
    As well, the patron may have a different focus in mind than any of these.
    I would of course follow up with the patron to be sure that this answered his question, and to see if he needed anything else, perhaps some additional books about partridges.

2.  I would first ask the patron what he or she needed the information for.
    Is it for a school assignment?
    If so, a short report or a long term paper?
    And, of course, if it is for a school assignment, I would ask if the patron has a copy of the assignment, just to be sure we get it right.

    After determining the overall needs, we can get to the questions themselves.
    There are really two questions, with possibly very different ways of answering them.
    For the first question, the person responsible for the posthumous publication of Bécquer's writings, the most likely source for the answer would be a biography.
    If the patron only needs a short answer, the biography from an encyclopedia may be enough and would be the easiest to find.
    _Britannica Online_ only states that friends published his works, but _Wikipedia_ identifies these friends as Rodríguez Correa, Narciso Campillo, Julio Nombela, and Augusto Ferrán.
    If a more detailed biography is required, a search through the local library catalog and WorldCat may serve to find something more in depth.
    Gale's _Encyclopedia of World Biography_ mentions _Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer: From Painter to Poet_ by Edmund L. King as a thorough work, though it is difficult to find even through WorldCat.
    Still, it may be the best bet if the patron needs an in-depth look and has time to deal with Interlibrary Loan.

    The second question, on English translations before the 20th century, has a few possible directions of attack.
    If the library has a copy available, the _American Book Publishing Record Cumulative 1876-1949_ may serve to check for anything from the right time period.
    A simpler, and possibly much better approach is to check the holdings of large, comprehensive libraries that have holdings from this time period.
    The Library of Congress shows two partial works that fit the criteria.
    They have _Modern ghosts: selected and translated from the works of Guy de Maupassant, Pedro Antonio de Alarcón, Alexander L. Kielland, Leopold Kompert, Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, and Giovanni Magherini-Graziani_ (no author or translator given) published in 1890, as well as _Love songs & other poems_ by Owen Innsly, first published in 1882, though reprinted in 1902.
    Both include translations of some of Bécquer's poetry, though it is not the primary focus.
    The British National Library has in its collection _Poems Rendered into English verse by M Carnes_, published in 1891, which is entirely translation of Bécquer's writings.
    So, indeed, there were translations before the 20th century.

3.  I would want to make sure I understood what the patron meant by "Floral Arts", as well as what was meant by "appropriate for a public library."
    The most common floral arts would be Floral Design and Arrangement, but it could also refer to more general art using flowers as a medium, or even to decorative gardening.
    The appropriateness would most likely mean it should be current, comprehensive, and usable by a large portion of potential patrons.
    Again, though, I would want to clarify what was meant.

    I will assume for the exercise that she wants books on Floral Arrangement and design, and that the list is intended for building a library's collection, at least in theory.
    One obvious place to begin looking would be in a large public library's collection, to see what books are already there.
    As one example, the Ramsey County Public Library at [rclreads.com] has "flower arrangement" as a subject heading, with 62 books currently in the collection.
    The San Jose library has a similar list of titles.

    The libraries on their own is probably not enough; they may not have the most current titles, and they likely have older titles that will not be available any longer.
    To make sure the list of titles is current, I would recommend a constantly updated resource such as _Books in Print_, as well as Amazon.com
    Amazon, like the library catalogs, includes "flower arrangement" as a searchable subject heading, as well as a dozen related terms.
    Amazon could be especially useful because, unlike the library catalogs or _Books in Print_, it can show the relative popularity of the different titles.
    A public library, almost certainly on a tight budget, can use this ranking and reader reviews to be sure they get the best and most wanted titles for their collection.

    A few titles I would recommend from this search:
    *  Some comprehensive titles, such as _Complete Guide to Flower Arranging_ by Jane Packer (1999) and _The Art of Floral Design_ by Norah T. Hunter (1999).
    *  Some more artistic titles, such as _Floral Art Structures_ by Gil Boyard, Muriel Le Couls, and Patrick Sordoillet (2007), or _Living Art: Style Your Home with Flowers_ by Olivier Giugni (2010).
    
    And so on, the possibilities are nearly endless.
    I would work with the patron to find out just what types of floral art books she needs, among the many options, so that she can find exactly the right titles.
