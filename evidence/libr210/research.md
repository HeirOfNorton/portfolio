So you need to research something for school, for a project, or just to learn about it.
You have googled till you can't google no more, and Wikipedia just doesn't have what you need.
Even the books you can find at the Library! don't cut it.
So what do you do now?
Now it's time to _really_ research, using databases of articles and information on anything you can think of.

There are hundreds of databases indexing millions of articles from journals, newspapers, magazines, and conferences.
This guide is to help you search through all of that and find just what you need for your research.
To get started, you need to know what you are looking for.

Finding Your Databases
----------------------

###Narrow Your Topic###

What are you learning about?
What do you need to find?
Different databases have different contents, usually under a specific topic or category.
You need to answer these questions, at least in general, before you can pick the right database.

If you are researching for a school assignment, that will usually give you a start.
Maybe you need to talk about poetry from the 18th Century.
Maybe you need to write a report on Quantum Physics.
Maybe you just want to know about ponies.
Any way you cut it, now you have a general topic.

###Find Out What's Available###

Some databases are free, but most cost money.
A lot of money.
A whole lot of money.
So if you want to access them, you either have to be rich, or you need to get at them through some other system.
Most school and public libraries will have subscriptions to various databases, so if you have a library card, then you're in business.
Different libraries have different subscriptions, though, so you need to find out what you can actually access.
Look on the library home page, usually under a heading like "Articles" or "Research", or ask a librarian.
You need to find out what all databases are available, so you know where you can start.

###Find Out What They Cover###

Different databases cover different thing.
You need to find out if the database you're looking at indexes journal articles, newspapers, magazines, or something else.
Databases focus on different subjects, as well.
Does it cover humanities articles, science reports, social science research, or literary critique?
It's no good searching a database for the latest on quantum mechanics when all the journals it indexes are geared toward Roman history.

Some databases are very general, covering nearly any topic, but they usually are more shallow and only index the most common journals for each topic.
Others get really specific, and index the obscure resources that you can't find any other way.
As well as the database topic, you also need to know the coverage level.
How many journals does the database index?
How many do they have the full text for, so you can read the article right on the website?
Some only index the abstracts. So much to find out!

Search for Sources
------------------

Okay, so now you know what database (or databases) you are going to search.
You've pulled up the page, and you have this big search bar right in front of you.
Should be easy enough, just like Google, right?
**Wrong!**
There's a lot more to searching a database than typing in a keyword and praying it works.
If you want to search like a pro, keep reading.

###Titles and Subjects and Authors, oh my!###

First of all, you can search for a lot of specific things in a database search.
Sure, you can just do a keyword search like in Google, but if you end up with 20,000 hits (like in Google), it will take forever to find the three articles you really need.
Instead, you can narrow it down a bit.
Sometimes all the options are right there on the main page, and sometimes you have to click on an "Advanced Search" option.
Either way, you'll get lots of ways to change the search.

The most obvious is to narrow your search to Subjects.
That way, it will only return articles that are definitely related to your keywords, because the authors or editors described it that way.
Or you can search by Author or Title, if you almost know the exact article you're looking for, but not quite.
Some databases even let you get really specific, like narrowing it by what journal or newspaper the article was in, who published it, or when it was published.
In short, use any of these options that seem relevant to get the best matches you can.

###AND, OR, NOT? What is This, Math?###

Database searches allow you to use what is called boolean logic to narrow (or broaden) the searches even further.
This means that you can say some words _must_ be in the results, other words _must not_ be in the results, and others must be _near_ one another.
To be fair, Google lets you do this too, but how often have you ever used that option?

Each database does it a little different, so you have to learn if the database you are using wants boolean keywords, like AND and NOT, or symbols, like + or -.
Some even have a dropdown box so you pick which one in between separate textboxes for each search term.
Once you have that figured out, you can start using the full power of boolean searching!

The main ways to search are using AND, OR, and NOT.
If you connect terms with AND, then both words _must_ appear in every item returned by the database.
If you connect them with OR, then _at least one_ of the terms must appear, but not all of them.
If you put a NOT in front of a term, then it _must not_ be in any of the results returned.
So you can search for "Harry OR Harold AND Potter NOT wizard NOT Rowling" if you want to find article about a person named Harry Potter without getting overwhelmed by articles about a teenage wizard in England.
Some databases also have XOR, or exclusive OR, which means one or the other of the terms but _not_ both.
Some also have a NEAR keyword, which means the search terms must appear within a few words of each other.
Once you learn what the database can do, you can make really powerful and detailed searches.

###Is it any Good, and Can I Read it Now?###

Finally, each database will have a few checkboxes to narrow the search still further.
These let you skip articles that may fit your search criteria, but are still not very useful for your search right now.

One checkbox will say "Peer Reviewed."
This will only show articles that have some authority, and are considered to be properly scholarly.
That's not to say that articles that are not peer reviewed are bad.
Almost all regular magazines and newspapers are not peer reviewed, and for many papers they are fine as sources.
However, peer reviewed articles are considered more academic and better research, and they have been checked for accuracy by other experts in the field.
Most of the time, your teacher will say if the sources you find must be peer reviewed, so if in doubt, ask.

The other one, very important, is "Full Text."
These databases offer lots of articles online, so you can read the whole thing as soon as you find it.
But not all of the articles.
A lot of journals and magazines are indexed, but not put online to read.
If you find out about the perfect article through a database, you might still need to find the article itself so you can read the thing.
And a lot of these articles can be almost impossible to find if you don't have a huge university library nearby.
So if you check Full Text, the only articles listed will be the ones you can read or print right there on your computer.

Are we Done Yet?
----------------

Now you're an expert at searching online databases!
You can find almost anything.
So go forth, research everything you need for your paper, and get it written.
Just don't forget to cite everything you use!

Some Example Resources
----------------------

There are hundreds of different article databases out there, but most of them are put out by a few major companies.
Listed here are just a few of the major databases you might use for your research.
There will be links, as well, but keep in mind that most of these databases require paid subscriptions.
To actually search the databases, you will need to access them through your local school or public library.
You should be able to find a list of databases offered by the library from their web page, or you can ask a librarian.

###[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com)###

Of course Google, the king of searching anything, also offers a way to search articles.
Google Scholar is not like a traditional database, but it searches most of the larger databases too, so you can get a large overview.
It does not have as many options for narrowing a search as a regular database, so there is a danger of getting thousands of irrelevant articles in your search.
It does allow you to search for free, but most of the articles it finds are still locked away behind subscription databases.
So all in all, Google Scholar can be a good place to start searching for articles, but you probably won't finish your search there.

###[ProQuest](http://search.proquest.com/)###

ProQuest is one of the oldest and largest database companies around.
They have several databases, including some for current and historical newspapers, business and economic journals, literary journals, and more.
