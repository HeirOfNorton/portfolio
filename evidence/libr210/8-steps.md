So you need to write a paper, but you're not sure how to do it!
Oh no!
Well, the team here at Write To Survive is here to help!
By just following these simple steps, you too can write an essay that leads to fame and fortune.

Or at least a B.

Step One: Pick a Topic, a Type, and a Length 
--------------------------------------------

###(aka What do you NEED to write?)###

**These are often assigned ahead of time. Know your assignment!**

*  Topics are broad and general:
    *  American Revolution
    *  Shakespeare's Plays
    *  The Unfairness of Grades
*  Types are What Kind of Paper:
    *  Research Paper
    *  Persuasive paper
    *  Compare/Contrast
*  Length is How Much Paper:
    *  One Page
    *  Five-paragraph essay
    *  12-page epic


Step Two: Brainstorm!
---------------------

###(aka I can't think of anything!)###

*  Different ways to brainstorm ideas for what to write
    *  Prewriting
    *  Word clouds
    *  Mind-mapping
    *  Questions and answers (and more questions)

**Narrow in on a _specific_ idea and a _specific_ position.**

Step Three: Research!
---------------------

###(aka Look like you know what you're talking about!)

**Read everything assigned!**

*  Find additional sources:
    *  Primary sources
        *  Memoirs from the time period and location
        *  The book/play itself that is the topic
        *  Students who have had grades before
    *  Secondary Sources
        *  Historical non-fiction books about the war
        *  Articles critiquing the plays
        *  Surveys about grades
    *  Tertiary sources
        *  Encyclopedia entries about the war, the plays, or grades
*  Use all of the resources available to you
    *  Library catalog (for books)
    *  Article databases (for articles)
    *  Google & Wikipedia (for unreliable sources)

**Find out as much as you can!**

Step Four: Your Thesis Statement
--------------------------------

###(aka Whatchoo Writin Bout, Willis?)###

*  Write a single sentence summing up the focus and position of your paper.
    *  Keep in mind the Topic and Type!
    *  Keep it original
    *  Keep it brief and focussed

Step Five: Outline your paper
-----------------------------

###(aka Divide and Conquer!)###

*  Divide your ideas up into related groups
    *  Divide those groups up into smaller pieces.
        *  And so on...
*  Use as many subdivisions and groups as you need (2 or 20)
*  Sort the groups so that they make sense _together_ and flow into one another.
*  Sort your research into each topic, so you have evidence in each one to support your topic.

Step Six: Write!
----------------

###(Finally!)###

**No, really, write your paper.**

*  Follow the outline you've created, but don't be afraid to change the outline as you go.
*  Use your research. Always give credit for the ideas and quotes you have found,
    and use it as evidence for your thesis.
*  Stay focussed, and remember to use everything you write to support your thesis and topic.

Step Seven: Rewrite! 
--------------------

###(Wait, what?!)###

**The paper is not done yet!**

*  Read through it to make sure all the ideas are clear and concise.
*  Make sure all sources are cited properly
*  Make sure you answer the assignment given for class
*  Make sure everything makes sense and flows together
*  Finally, _proofread_ and make sure there are no spelling or grammar errors.

Step Eight: Turn it in!
-----------------------

###(Whew!)###

*  Make sure you do not forget this most important step!
*  Relax for the weekend, until the next assignment.
