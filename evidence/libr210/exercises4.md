>   I have been rather disappointed with the electronic reference services I have received in the last couple reports. In light of this, I have decided to structure this last set of exercises as if the questions were received in an electronic format.

##1. I'm looking for a printed copy of the final report the official commission wrote about 9-11. Considering I live in Bellingham, where can I take a look at it?

_Received in the "Ask a Librarian" feedback form for our hypothetical library._

Response:

Thank you for your question. I will do my best to help you find the information you need. Any useful links or resources I find will be listed at the end of this email.

You specify that you need a printed copy of the report. I believe the report is widely available, so let me just check which libraries in your area have a copy. According to WorldCat, the Bellingham Public Library and Western Washington State University's library both have copies available. These are the common copies, available at most bookstores, as well. You do not say in your question why you need to find a copy, if it's for school or another kind of research, so I hope this would work for you.

If you need something more official, then you can try a government depository, though you may need to travel a bit further. http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp?flag=searchp&st_12=WA lists all of the depositories in Washington State. WWU's library is a partial depository, as is the University of Washington in Seattle. Either of those should have the official government version of the report made by the government printing office. The should also have additional documents in the repository to support the report, if you needed more than just the final report itself.

Though you asked for a printed version, I should also mention that the complete report is available for free online at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/index.html.

I hope this answers your question. If you still need more information, please email us again.

##2. How much did the federal government spend on national defence in 1942?

_Connecting to Chat_

Librarian: Hello, welcome to our chat reference service. Just one moment while I read the question.

Librarian: For your question, is this for class or for something else?

Patron: It's for a paper I'm writing for school.

Librarian: Okay. How much detail do you need? To you just need a total dollar figure, or something more detailed that breaks it down further?

Patron: Just the total amount should be enough.

Librarian: Alright, there's a couple places where we should be able to find that information. Are you a student of SJSU? That might determine which resources you can access.

Patron: Yes, I'm a student.

Librarian: Good. One place to check is the Historical Statistics of the United States. ([link](http://library.calstate.edu/sanjose/databases/proxy/CAL19975)) You have to login through the SJSU library to access it. This statistics and tables for the US going back years, but it can be kind of a pain to search through.

Librarian: The government printing office also has the _Historical Tables of the Budget of the United States_, which you can access for free online.

Patron: What's in that one?

Librarian: It's a book of tables showing government budget and spending since about 1940. The current edtion is here: ([link](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=&packageId=BUDGET-2012-TAB)). Taking a quick look at it, it looks like total spendind is listed on page 135. It has national defence as being 25.6 billion dollars, but that's in current dollars. I'm not sure about 1942 dollars. That's 17.8% of the GDP, and 73% of all spending for that year. There is probably more detail in some of the pages.

Patron: Okay, thanks. That's a good start, anyway.

Librarian: Will that work for your paper, or do you need another source?

Patron: I think that will work.

Librarian: Great! Do you need help with anything else right now?

Patron: No, that's good.

Librarian: Thanks again for using our service! If you need anything, please log in again or email us at xxxx@xxxx.edu. Also, if you have the time, please take the srvey at the end of this chat session.

_Chat session has ended.


##3. Can you find me a list of Standing Committees of the Senate and their members?

Resonse:

Thank you for your question. I'm sure I can help you find that.

First, since you didn't specify, I'm going to assume you meant the U.S. Senate and not any particular State Senate. If I'm wrong, go ahead and resubmit the question mentioning which state senate you need to know about.

The best source for basic information on the current Senate is at their web page, [Senate Web Page](www.senate.gov). It includes a page specifically about the standing committees and subcommittee, which detail their area of responsibility and current members.

If you needed to do more in-depth research, and you are just using the committees as a jumping off point, I would recommend _ProQuest Government Periodicals Index_ and _ProQuest Congressional_ as great resources for finding articles and documents. They are available through the library's databases index, if you are a student at SJSU. If you are not, check with your own library, they might be able to offer access to them or other government indexes.

None of these have a simple list, like you asked, though. If you just need a basic list of standing committees and their members, there is a good one at Wikipedia: [List of Senate Committess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Senate_committees). I've copied the basic list at the end of this email so you can print it, if you need to.

I hope that answered you question. If it didn't, or if you need help with anything else, please contact us again or come into the library in person!
