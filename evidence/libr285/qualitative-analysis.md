The Internet Public Library (www.ipl2.org) is a web site that has been around since 1995, and originally had the goal of gathering and sorting the many resources available on the web and helping librarians and the public search through them as well as a physical library helps them find books. Authors Maceli, Wiedenbeck, and Abels (2011) of Drexel University were unsure of how relevant the IPL still was in today's much more wired world, and set out to discover what people's perceptions were about the IPL itself, as well as about the idea of an Internet public library. They did this with a qualitative study, interviewing several students at their own university to discover the common elements of their perceptions and beliefs about the IPL.

For this exploratory study, the authors chose to interview a small number of students who were patrons at Drexel University's main library. They recruited ten students with a variety of backgrounds and majors, and differing levels of public library experience, though all of the students had some library experience. They conducted short, semi-structured interviews with their respondents, asking in particular what their perceptions were of an Internet public library, and what services and materials they thought such a library should offer. They then analyzed the transcripts using an inductive phrase-coding technique to discover common themes among many or all of their respondents. They found common among their respondents confusion about the actual origin and services of the IPL, excitement about the ease and credibility of such a resource, and the desire for connections both a physical libraries, and real librarians to help with questions.

The authors used a semi-structured interview format for their study, asking broad, open-ended questions and encouraging their respondents to answer naturally in order to get an accurate picture of each student's experiences and perceptions. This technique allows the authors to find out what the students truly knew or believed without biasing them with too-specific questions that might limit their responses too much. However, this might also lead to shallow responses that do not truly represent all of their thoughts on the matter. For a second study, it might be worthwhile to use an in-depth interview, to discover what matters most to each respondent in an Internet public library. On the other hand, such an in-depth interview might lead to responses that are more individualized, and less applicable to the public at large. Anyone conducting a follow-up study will have to carefully weigh the need for detail against the need for broad applicability.

The method used to correlate the data also has some interesting implications. They pulled out key words and ideas, using an inductive coding scheme to identify common ideas and thoughts among all the interviews. Something of the sort is necessary in order to keep all of the data relevant; though it is a qualitative study, the data must be quantified in some way to make it useful. They used this method to identify six major common themes, including confusion about what "internet public library" actually means, the belief that an IPL may combine speed and convenience with greater credibility, and the need for personalized help from staff via instant message, among others. Distilling a semi-structured interview into common ideas is useful in that it helps identify what ideas are most important to the greatest number of people. There is a risk, though, that these common ideas may not be as common as they appear. Words can mean different things to different people, and it is possible that the method of coding phrases into themes may be combining subtly or substantially different things into one. The exact coding scheme is glossed over in the paper, making it difficult to determine how well these potential differences are taken into account.

The aspect of the study with perhaps the greatest effect on its validity, though, is in the method for selecting respondents for the study. The ten people chosen are all students at the same university, and were in fact selected at the main library for the university. There was a mix of male and female, graduate and undergraduate, and several different majors. However, the location of their recruitment ensured that all of them had at least some library experience, and that they were all at least somewhat technically proficient. The authors chose respondents who were most likely to have useful opinions and perceptions about libraries in general, and of an IPL as compared to the thousands of other readily available web sites out there. However, the study is intended to gauge perceptions of an Internet _public_ library, which from the start was intended for all users. University students have very different needs for libraries, and indeed the interviews showed that all of them were more familiar with their school's academic library than with any public library. By limiting the respondents this way, the study cannot be completely valid for a large number, possibly the majority, of the IPL's user base.

This study represents a decent first step in discovering user perceptions of the IPL, and therefor leading to improving it, but it is only a first step. It has identified several key areas and needs, but these may only be relevant for part of the population that uses the Internet public library. Further research should refine the interview process to help find what issues are the most important for their respondents. It should take care that the methods used to correlate the information gathered truly represent the thoughts and perceptions of their subjects. Most of all, further research must broaden out to include representatives of all of the IPL's users, not just those already predisposed to get the most out of it.
