subtitle: A Proposal for Quantitative Study

abstract: |
    This is a proposal for research to study members of fan communities. Fan communities, such as those around _Star Trek_ and _My Little Pony_, can attract large numbers of people, but they are often misunderstood and stigmatized by people outside of the community. In order to better understand them, this study proposes to conduct a broad survey of members of several fan communities. The survey will be used to determine the fans' level of participation in fandom related activities, as well as their personality traits, to determine if there are any common characteristics that could help explain the existence of fan communities in general. The author works from the hypothesis that fan communities fill a similar need as more traditional social groups such as churches and school clubs, but is not ruling out other explanations and will conduct the survey with no preconceptions in mind. The survey would be conducted over two to three months, using mostly web-based means.

Introduction
------------

Fans. They can sociable or introverted. They can be creative or outright creepy. They can be casual or obsessive. In many ways, though, fans and fan communities are still a mystery. Fan communities can form around television series, around popular novels, even around specific celebrities. It is no surprise that people who like something will often seek out others who do as well, but many fan communities seem to go far beyond that. Some fan communities create entire subcultures around their fandom, with costumes and uniforms, slang and customs, and libraries worth of fan-made creative works that are unknown outside of the community. They often even have names for themselves, sometimes chosen by the fan community and other times forced on them from outside, such as Trekkies (fans of _Star Trek_), Bronies (fans of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_), and Browncoats (fans of _Firefly_). These fan communities are often treated with ridicule or outright hostility by non-fans, but there is still very much that is not understood about them. This paper is to propose a broad, quantitative study of fan cultures in order to compare them to other types of social group and therefor to better understand how they work and why people belong to them.

This study would in particular look at fan communities as social groups, and how they relate to other, more traditional social groups. Much research, including that of Newman, Lohman, and Newman (2007), has shown that many people feel a need to belong to social groups, and that this sense of belonging can improve self-esteem and reduce the amount of destructive thoughts and behaviors that a person experiences. Usually these groups are long established and well-known, such as a church or an academic club. Sometimes they are less accepted, but still fill the same niche, such as youth gangs or cliques. For many people, it appears that fan communities may fulfill the same needs, and this study proposes to test this idea. In particular, this study will survey members of these communities about their level of participation in the fan culture, their participation in more traditional social group activities, as well as their personality traits, in an attempt to discover what aspects of personality lead one to become a member of a fan community, and if those aspects correlate with those that would lead a person to more traditional groups.

Literature Review
-----------------

There has not been much recent research into the phenomenon of fan communities from a sociological point of view. What research there is often delves into the psychology of individuals, trying to discover why people are drawn to fan cultures, and sometimes trying to assign an illness or pathology to fans. While the potential for pathology should not be ignored, this study should always strive to maintain objectivity, neither looking for nor ignoring possible mental health implications in its respondents.

The research of Maltby, McCutcheon, and Lowinger (2011) is an attempt to tie fandom to personality traits in a similar way to this proposed study. Their work is specifically focussed on celebrity worship, fandoms centered on single famous individuals rather than on works of pop culture. They administered both the _Celebrity Attitude Scale_ (CAS) and the _Revised NEO Personality Inventory_ (NEO PI-R) to their respondents to determine if different types and levels of celebrity worship corresponded to different personality traits. They found that there was a correlation, discovering that people who scored high on the CAS Entertainment-social scale also scored higher for Extraversion, and that those who scored high on the CAS Intense-personal scale were more likely to show Neuroticism. This shows that there is a basis for thinking that personality traits could correspond and predict fan culture behavior, thougg there is no standardized test for pop culture fandom to correspond with the CAS that the authors used.

Burr's (2005) paper addresses fan culture and fan identity directly. The author explores the dichotomy felt by an academic attempting to study fandom who is also a fan. The paper touches upon the need for objectivity, but also the question of whether complete objectivity is possible or desired. It serves as context for this study's research, but the paper itself is largely a personal narrative, with anecdotes from other academics on the same topic, and is not itself proper research. It shows that the question is there, but does nothing to try to answer the question in a scientific fashion.

The research by Cusack, Jack, and Kavanagh (2003) is a more straightforward study of one of the oldest and most recognizable of fan cultures, that surrounding _Star Trek_. The authors conducted a qualitative study of _Star Trek_ fans, their social identity, and the social stigma they face as _Star Trek_ fans. They interviewed people who were both highly active in the fandom and those who were casual members of the fandom. The research was largely exploratory, with very open ended questions and interviews with a goal of discovering as much information as possible. They found that the informants, along with many other "Trekkies," face complex problems as they try to balance their public identities with their fan identities. In particular, the problems they face when they try to expose their fandom identities in a public context, and how they attempt to escape stigmatization. Their research speaks directly to the need for more knowledge about members of fan cultures, in order to understand them and to reduce stigmatization where it exists.

_Star Trek_ is also the main focus for Jindra (1994), though in a much different context. He compares the _Star Trek_ fan culture to religious culture and argues that it forms a new kind of religion. He describes the fandom's rituals, group dynamics, and even the accepted canon of works. His research suggests that, at the very least, _Star Trek_ fandom fills the same sociological need as religion, for some of its adherents, anyway. His research is a beginning, but is largely limited to outside observation and comparison of texts and rituals. There has nat yet been a more detailed survey of fans as a whole to further support the idea. As well, his observations were made before the spread of the World Wide Web, with USENET discussion groups being the only internet presence that yet existed.

Löbert (2012) also compares fandom activities to religious rites, though she focusses on fans of specific musicians rather than fan of media works. Nonetheless, she also sees parallels in the way fans think about and act toward the object of their fandom, and the thoughts and activities of people regarding their religion. She attempts to categorize fans by their fandom activities, separating activities that occur with and without other fans, and those that occur with and without the object of the fandom, in this case the musician. This paradigm of treating different fan behaviors as indicative of different kinds of fans, who should almost be considered as different communities, is something to consider while analyzing the data for this research. Again, though, Löbert's research is exploratory and rather small scale, and points to the need for a larger study with more vigorous questions to test.

Of course, there are other possible parallels with fandom than religion and social groups. Rudski, Segal, and Kallen (2008) took a look at _Harry Potter_ fans and found parallels with addiction. When they surveyed self-described fans of the _Harry Potter_ novels, they discovered that many showed symptoms of craving leading up to the release of a new book, and symptoms of withdrawal after they finished reading one of the books. Their research focusses more on the feelings of individual fans toward the work rather than on the fan culture created by these fans, but the alternate interpretation of fan behavior is one that should be closely considered. I should not rule out addiction or similar interpretations in favor of fan culture fulfilling a social need unless the evidence, after the survey is done, supports this idea.

Finally, I should mention a large scale study currently being conducted on a fan culture. Edwards and Redden (2012) are, at the time of this writing, in the second phase of their _Brony Study_, large exploratory surveys of "Bronies," adult (and mostly male) fans of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. Their research is largely an attempt to understand Bronies, and includes many items relating to age and sexual orientation, level of participation in the fan culture, religious and spiritual beliefs and practices, and reasons for watching _My Little Pony_ and for self-identifying as a Brony. This also includes beliefs and experiences with the stigmatization related to the fandom. Initial results of the first survey are available on their web site, but so far they have not published and the second survey is still ongoing. Their research has similar aims to this proposed study, but it is limited to the single fandom and the questions to be answered are somewhat broader and more exploratory.

Methodology
-----------

The goal of this research is to learn about people who are members of fan communities, and as such they are the main population for study. This population is, however, very difficult to meaningfully define, and even harder find and recruit for research. For this research, a **fan** is someone who enjoys and regularly takes part in a particular work from popular culture, such as a television series or series of novels. A **fan culture** is an informal community that has grown around these fans, consisting of communication, gatherings and meetings, and the creation of original creative works based on the original work. A **participating fan** is a fan is directly participates in this fan culture, while a **casual fan** is one who enjoys the original work but does not participate in the fan culture.

The main population for this study are the participating fans who are a part of a fan culture, to a greater or lesser extant, but the samples used in the study will also include casual fans and non-fans for comparison and control. Actually finding a representative sample for study can be very difficult, as these are very informal groups and there are not any common membership lists to identify them. As well, some members of fan cultures may be reluctant to join in the study because many such fan cultures face bias and social stigma from the greater population. Care must be taken to assure potential study respondents that all responses will remain anonymous, and that the study as a whole will remain objective.

For this research, I have chosen the fan cultures around the television series _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, the _Discworld_ series of novels, and the animated series _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ as the main sources of respondents. Each of these fan communities is large, they are each different in medium and genre, and they attract a wide variety of fans. They are also widely known even to non-fans, and they have different amounts of social stigma attached to their fandoms. For a sample frame, I will use the casual "fan pages" on social networking sites such as Facebook and Yahoo. These social networking and sites are unrelated to fandom on their own, and it is very simple to "fan" something that a person likes, so a variety of casual and participating fans can be expected to join. These will be supplemented by fandom specific web sites, which overwhelmingly attract participating fans while often being ignored by casual fans.

Members of these groups will be invited to complete a thorough survey online, with the invitations going out as a message to all members if possible, or as a post on the site if direct messaging is not available. Similar invitations will also be posted in unrelated groups to invite non-fans for a control.

It is almost impossible to know how well these samples will represent the total target population. As stated, many members of these populations are reluctant to identify themselves, which may affect the sample. It is unknown if the memberships of the fan pages we are using reflect the total memberships of the fan communities, although the use of both general and fan specific pages is done in an attempt to reduce bias. The use of an anonymous internet survey may bias the results toward computer users, but I believe this is not a major problem since the fan cultures being studies often exist primarily through the internet. In the end, we simply have to accept that for a targeted study like this one, total representativeness may be impossible to achieve.

The survey conducted will measure several key variables about the people who respond. First, of course, would be how well they fit into the target population. Questions will measure their **fandom participation** based on how often they communicate with other fans, how much they participate in fan activities such as meetings and conventions, and how much they make or consume creative works like fan-fiction or fan-art. The respondents will also be asked how much they identify themselves as fans and as members of the fan culture. The respondents will also be asked basic demographic information, in particular **age**, **gender**, and **sexual identity**, as many myths about these fan cultures relate to these facts.

The second group of questions will relate to the respondents' personalities. Questions will in particular measure **Extraversion**, **Introversion**, and **Neuroticism**. Along with these basic personality traits, the questionnaire will also ask about the respondents **desire to be in a social group**, rated from very weak to very strong, as well as **attitude towards social groups**, rated as very positive to very negative.

A third group of questions will be about the respondents participation in group cultures and activities that are not related to popular culture, such as religious participation or civic participation. They will be asked how often they participate in different activities, such as going to church or attending town hall meetings, as well as their attitudes toward these activities, in order to judge their **social group participation**. They will also be asked how much they identify themselves as a part of these groups, and whether they identify differently with groups that they actively participate in from groups for which they think of themselves only as members.

The data will be collected using a web-based survey, with questions grouped together onto several individual pages to prevent data loss part way through the questionnaire. A non-reversible hash number will be created based on each respondent's IP address and stored with the responses, and only a limited number of responses will be accepted from each IP address, in order to reduce "ballot stuffing" from single respondents completing the survey multiple times. However, the IP address itself will not be saved, and no identifying personal data will be collected, in order to keep the surveys fully anonymous. 

The primary analysis of the data will be to determine which, if any, personality traits are most closely related to membership and participation in a fan culture. Regression analysis will be used to relate each of the personality traits with the level of participation each person has with their chosen fandom. The results from each of the fan cultures studied will be compared, to see if they are consistent with one another or if members of one fan culture respond differently than members of a different fan culture. If they are consistent, this will suggest that the results are relevant for fandom as a whole and not just for fans of a particular part of popular culture.

Similar regression analysis will also be used to compare fan culture participation with non-fan social group participation. In particular, the variables will be analyzed to see if people who are a part of fan cultures are more or less likely to participate in other social groups, and how both kinds of participation relate to a desire to belong to social groups or attitudes toward different kinds of social groups. The hypothesis that began this research suggests that similar personality types would be drawn toward fan cultures and social groups for similar reasons, but this could manifest in people participating in both, or in having one type of participation take the place of another, so only one becomes common for a person. The study will be used to see which, if either, is in fact the case.

I would expect the total length of the study to require about two to three months. The initial weeks will be to design the survey itself and to set up the web site to host it. The design will go through several iterations while deciding which questions are most relevant and which questions are either irrelevant or redundant. Once the survey is made available online, then the word needs to get out to the sample groups that it exists and that I need their participation. I would need to contact the administrators of several of the fan sites, and possibly the moderators of the social network groups, to get permission and find out the correct format for pasting to their groups about the survey. Once the information is posted, I would expect it to take at least a month for enough people to read the post and learn about the survey, but also for enough of them to respond to the survey. The final month will be devoted to gathering all of the data from the collection server and analyzing the results.

The survey is intended to be relatively simple and cost effective for only one or very few people to administer. This study would require $500 for space and bandwidth on a reliable web server with the speed and resources to handle potentially hundreds or thousands or people taking the survey at once. Another $500 for a freelance web design specialist to create the web page that hosts the survey. $1500 for computer equipment and data analysis software for the main researcher. Finally, $500 a month in wages for a part-time assistant to help maintain the web page, gather the data, and convert the data as necessary into the correct format for the analysis software, for three months at the current assumed schedule. This brings the total tentative budget to $4000 for this study.
