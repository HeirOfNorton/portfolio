##Database Pupose and User Group

San Jose State University is offering a seminar on authority and
demographics throughout American history. The accepted image of an
authority figure, in particular such aspects as age, race, and sex, has
changed greatly throughout the years. This seminar gives its students
the opportunity to study the ways it has changed, and how well people
with authority are accepted or challenged in their roles. One major unit
of the seminar concerns itself with the United States Supreme Court and
its makeup over the last two centuries. To support this unit, a database
has been created with a substantial cross-section of supreme court
justices. The database mainly covers demographic data such as the
justices race and sex, their age upon joining the supreme court and on
leaving, as well as their reasons for leaving, and their political
interests and affiliations. There is brief data on major cases on which
each justice rendered an opinion, but case law is not the focus of the
database and is included mainly to give additional information about the
justice him or herself.

Users of the database will all be students who are interested in the
statistics and demographics of the supreme court. Many of the students
are sociology or history majors, though with a number of other students
as well taking the course as an elective. Few if any of the students
will be studying for law, though some may have a layman's interest. The
database will allow the students to perform a wide variety of
statistical queries on the data. Students can narrowly focus on justices
from a certain time period, justices who served at a particular age, and
justices with specific political affiliations. They can also select
based on how mush of the senate confirmed the justice, to tracks how
accepted they were at the time of their nomination, and whether they
served as chief justice or not. The database is a tool for the students
to judge how factors such as age, politics, and sex have changed the
makeup of the court over the years, and how that reflects the changing
public image of who can be an authority figure.

##Experiential Log

Details regarding the field rules and data entry instructions are
included in this log. Most of the data are required, to improve the
richness of the database and allow the most ability of search queries.
The only exceptions are for data that may not be applicable, such as
Date of Death when the current and several former justices are still
alive, and data that may not exist, such as political affiliation when
several justices were not affiliated with any pary and attempted to
remain apolitical. All of the data is indexed and may be used as a
search term, as virtually all of the data entered into the database is
potentially useful for statistical or demographic searches.

1.  **Record Number** - This field is automatically generated by
    DBTextworks and serves as a control field.

2.  **Name** - The name of the Supreme Court Justice serves as the
    identifier field, and must be unique. The name is controlled using
    the Library of Congress Name Authority file to ensure consistancy,
    and to allow the entries to be unique even if two justices have the
    same name. The field allows term indexing for queries that follow
    the LoC Name Authority exactly, as well as keyword indexing to allow
    for less strict searches of the justices names.

3.  **Judicial Title** - This field gives the title which the justice
    held while they served on the supreme court. It uses a validation
    list, with the only allowable entries being Associate Justice and
    Chief Justice, in order to force correctly formatted and consistant
    entries. Originally there was a third option, "Both", to allow for
    justices who served as both Associate Justice and Chief justice. The
    intention was to make this field the classification field, with the
    belief that the justice's title constituted the most important way
    to classify the different justices. However, this was found to be
    unworkable in practice. The main comes with searches, in that a
    search for all Chief Justices would need to select not only entries
    of "Chief Justice", but also entries with "Both". This behaviour is
    very counterintuitive. In the end, our group decided to change rule
    five so that this is not single entry, allowing the appropriate
    justices to have both titles listed in their records. As a result,
    this field could no longer be a classification field.

4.  **Date of Birth** - A simple date field giving the day on which the
    justice was born. This, and all other date fields, require entry in
    the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY, as this is currently the most consistant
    date format that prevents confusion of the date and month sections.
    As a date format, instead of plain text, it allows for searching not
    only of exact dates, but also date ranges and all dates before or
    after a specific date. This allows the students to find all justice
    who were born before certain dates, or after. In the later fields,
    it similarly would allow searches for all justices who served within
    a particular span of time.

5.  **Date of Death** - Another simple date field in the same format as
    field \#4. This field is not required, and should be left blank for
    justices and former justices who are still alive. It should allow
    students to discover trends in how long justices live after they
    leave the court, or how many only leave the court upon their own
    death.

6.  **Date of Nomination** - Another simple date field. This field
    should only include the dates of successful nominations, and should
    omit any previous nominations to the court for which the nominee was
    not confirmed. Like field \#3, this is not marked single entry to
    allow for justices who served as both Associate and Chief Justice
    during their careers.

7.  **Date of Confirmation** - This date field marks the date on which
    the justice was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and is the date on
    which their term of office began. The difference between the Date of
    Confirmation and the Date of Termination is the official length of
    their service on the supreme court. Including both the date of
    Nomination and Confirmation allows the users to see how much time
    passed between the two events, as to see if there is any correlation
    with the number of votes which upheld the confirmation. It could be
    used as evidence to show the perception of the justice's right to
    Authority, and how well they were accepted or challenged by the
    members of the senate.

8.  **Nominating President** - This field is the name of the President
    of the United States who nominated the justice to their position on
    the supreme court. It is validated using the Library of Congress
    Name Authority file. Like the main Name field, this field allows for
    both term and word indexing so that users can search or narrow
    queries with only a partial or common name, instead of requiring the
    exact format of the entry. The intention of this entry is to allow
    users to find all of the justices nominated by a specific
    presidents, so that they can spot trends or similarities, or even
    biases in the nomination process.

9.  **Confirming Vote** - This field shows the margin by which the
    justice was confirmed by the Senate, if known. When the vote tally
    is known, the preferred format is \#\#-\#\#, with the confirming
    voted listed first. However, on several occasions justices were
    confirmed with a voice vote rather than a full official vote, and in
    those situations an exact tally was not recorded, only the final
    result. For these records, a text value of "Voice vote" is entered
    instead. For a revision to the database, a way should be found to
    split this into multiple fields, so that users can select records
    based on the number of confirming or dissenting votes the justice
    received. This would allow users to find statistical data on how
    accepted a nominee was by the Senate, and therefor how well their
    authority was accepted at the time, and this data could be combined
    with other fields in an attempt to find a correlation.

10. **Reason for Termination** - Those who have served on the supreme
    court are classified, perhaps paradoxically, by how they came to
    leave the court. This field lists such reasons, and it allows only a
    single entry which must come from the validation list. All currently
    known methods by which a supreme court justice has left the court
    are included, as well as an option for "Currently serving" just the
    nine justices that are still on the bench. The list differentiates
    between Retirement and Resignation, as a few justices have quit the
    bench relatively early in their careers due to moral or other
    conflicts. The differences between the two options are not clear
    cut, however, and in a revision to the database they may be combined
    into a single option to make the field less confusing for users.

11. **Date of Termination** - The last Date field, this one lists the
    date on which the justice left the bench, for whatever reason. This
    is a single entry field, and should only list the time that a
    justice left the supreme court permanantly, and should not include
    those times when a justice left the post of Associate Justice in
    order to serve as Chief Justice. This field is also not required,
    and should be omitted for those justices still currently serving.

12. **Major Cases and Interests** - This field is a catch-all allowing
    multiple text entries listing important cases on which the justice
    voted or rendered an opinion, as well as general interests in
    jurisprudence and politics. It is included mainly to give the user
    base a bit of context on the work of each justice. Originally this
    was two separate fields, one for the cases and another the
    interests, and it could become so again in a revision to the
    database. If so, it would be best if the Important Cases could be
    validated and kept consistant using an external vocabulary or name
    authority. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any such authority,
    though the various law databases available on the web appear to
    follow consistant naming strategies that could be adopted. In the
    end, though, this database is intended for students of sociology and
    history, not law, and the focus is on the justices themselves, not
    on their case history. A fully indexed and validated case field is
    simply unnecessary, and possibly distracting from the purpose of the
    data.

13. **Political Affiliation** - This field is a non-validated text
    field, allowing a record of each justice's political leanings, if
    any. Entries should include both a justice's declared political
    party, if known, as well as general political leanings such as
    "liberal" or "conservative". Like the Major Cases and Interests,
    this field is intended to give context to the life and work of each
    justice. Students could correlate this data with the dates served,
    to show the political leaning of the court as a whole at different
    times. They could also combine this with the nominating president,
    to show if there were particular trends based on who did the
    nominating. This field a not required, as not every justice had an
    affiliation with a particular political party. Many did not even
    have discernable leanings to the left or right, and remained
    staunchly apolitical throughout their careers, in which case there
    is little that can be included in this entry.

14. **Race/Ethnicity** - This field allows users to track the racial and
    ethnic diversity of the court, as well as to see if there are any
    trends between race and the other demographic data. Until fairly
    recently, this field would not have been required, as every supreme
    court justice was caucasian. That has changed in recent decades, and
    can be expected to continue to change in the years to come. The
    allowed values for this field present a unique challenge, as many
    people identify differences in race or ethnicity in different ways
    from others. We chose to validate the entries based on the
    terminology used in the US 2010 Census, as this is the closest thing
    to a central authority currently available. The field allows
    multiple entries, and indeed allows the vocabulary to be overridded
    on a record-by-record basis, to allow for justices who indentify as
    multiple races, or in a way that is not yet accepted by the census
    bureau.

15. **Sex** - Like Race/Ethnicity, this field is one that has only
    become necessary within the last few decades. It could nonetheless
    prove usefull, allowing queries to correlate sex with age, race, or
    other demographic data to see if there are any trends that are
    different between the men and women of the court. It currently
    validates as either Male or Female. It is interesting to note,
    though, that the modern world's changing attitudes about gender
    roles and alternate sexualities may make this field a great deal
    more complex one day.

##Evaluation

One of the biggest challenges for this database was choosing which data
should be left out as irrelevant, or at least unnecessary, to the
proposed user group. After all, the students are not studying law and
for the most part will not care about every single case for which the
justices wrote an opinion. As it is, the database covers a great deal of
demographic information that should be usefull for doing statistical
analysis of the data, especially within the context of authority and
perception of authority.

##Changes to be Made

One aspect of the database that I am not entirely satisfied with is the
abundance of date fields. While the dates are all important, I cannot
help but feel there is a better way to get the information across,
something that makes the data easier to grasp and to correlate and
compare. Perhaps number fields giving the length of time served in
office, or age at nomination. The dates on their own is the most
flexible, as that allows for nearly any comparison between them with a
well-designed query, but it is also left somewhat abstract, and left
entirely up to the users to extract such information from the data. For
the user group that it is designed for, I think a little bit more
clarity adds value, even if it does reduce the flexibility a little bit.

As stated in the log, I was also not happy with how the Confirmation
Votes turned out. In order to accommodate voice votes, the field needed
to be made into a simple text field. This makes it difficult to compare
different records in any meaningful way, except possibly to show that
one justice received more votes than another. Again, I would prefer to
have pure numeric fields for confirming and dissenting votes so that
ranges and comparisons are possible, and make them optional with the
assumption that the justice was confirmed with a voice vote if these
fields are omitted from a record.

The only other substantial change I would like to make is to add more
data, though of course that would be outside the bounds of the
assignment. Data on the number of court opinions and dissenting opinions
written could be useful, even to history students, as well as any poll
data that shows public opinion of the job done by the Supreme Court.
More specific personal information would also be useful for demographic
information, such as the size of the justices' families, their ages at
marriage, and so on.

##DBTextworks

I had a great deal of trouble getting the software set up, but once it
was up and running I had little trouble using it. The interface is
sometimes unintuitive, and in particular I often found myself wishing it
was easier just to list all of the records together and edit them on the
fly, like is done in a spreadsheet. While hammering out the data
structure with the other members of my group and entering the data, I
did wish it was possible to collaborate with them on a single database.
I had the problem that I have some familiarity with large relational
databases that use SQL, and know how much more powerful they can be, and
sometimes missed that power when using DBTextworks. Of course, those
powerful databases are also much heavier and more difficult to use,
often requiring the use of a command line, if not outright programming,
in order to get to those powerful features, so it is a trade off.

##Conclusion

Though more information would be nice, I think the database serves very
well as is for its intended purpose. The database is meant for
demographic and statistical data, not for law review, and given the
limitations imposed I think that the most important data for that
purpose was chosen. The users would be able to make a large number of
very relevant queries on the data provided, and the data gathered would
be useful for the intended purpose of tracking the changes in the
supreme court over time, especially the changes in what people may be
viewed as authority figures and how well they are accepted in that role.
