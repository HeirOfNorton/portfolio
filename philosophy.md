title: Statement of Professional Philosophy
---

I began my courses for the Master of Library and Information Science a little over two years ago with only a vague sense of what I would be doing, and a strong feeling for why I wanted this degree.
I knew that I wanted to help people, that I wanted to be of service, but I was not completely sure specifically how I would do so.
My fundamental value, my reason for beginning this program, was a dedication to service, and a desire for the skills to provide that service.
I have since learned that this is one of the most important values for all of the information profession, and nearly every aspect is in some way related to that value.
A philosophy can be defined as a statement of wisdom, or a way of understanding something.
I believe, though, that understanding alone is useless without the knowledge and will to make use of that understanding.
This, then, is how I have come to understand Library and Information Science, and how I plan to use that understanding in my career to better help the people I serve.

I came to the MLIS program out of a mixture of frustration and optimism.
After completing my undergraduate degree, I fell into retail sales and management, and I have been working my way up the ranks for nearly a decade.
In that time, I have come to realize that I love working with customers, finding out what makes them tick and helping them to find what they need, but I hate the focus on sales and the almighty dollar.
A profession in which I am reprimanded if I do not put a certain number of people into debt each day is not one I wish to be a part of.
I have always had a strong connection both to libraries as a place, and to information as an idea, and so the thought of becoming an information professional was like a dream come true.
Even better, though, was the thought of using these connections to help other people, which would allow me all of the aspects of my current profession that I love, with none of the ones that I hate.

Thus I began my MLIS career with excitement and optimism, looking forward to the time when I could get out into the trenches and provide useful and worthwhile service for people, and this optimism has only grown as I have completed my coursework.
I knew that I would have a lot to learn, and the journey has at times been exhausting, but I have never doubted that it was worth the effort.
The technical aspects alone are nearly overwhelming, as I started with only a rough familiarity of the Dewey Decimal system and the Library of Congress Classification, but I had never even heard of MARC coding, AACR2, or any of dozens of other acronyms and standards.
I held and still hold strong beliefs about the importance of intellectual freedom, but only knew the surface of how information professional defend that freedom, and the external forces for good or ill that affect that battle.
I assumed that I would have a great deal more coursework relating to books and organization, but I am glad of the stronger focus on service concepts that truly characterized my coursework.
I entered this program with a desire to help people, and in the end the overall theme of my program has been how best to do just that.

I believe that the core purpose of Library and Information Science, the core service concept, is to connect users to the information they want and need.
Libraries are at heart repositories of information, and there is no point in storing and preserving information unless it is to be used.
My feelings on this have been refines over the last two years, as I have seen that there are many more kinds of information, and many more ways to store and access that information, than I ever realized before.
This has not changed the central thought, though, that the information is kept so that it can be used by people, ideally by any people who wish to use it, and that the greatest service an information professional can give is to bring those people and the right information together.
I will keep this tenet locked in my core as I enter the next part of my career and begin providing this service personally to my clients.

This is not to say, though, that I plan to be a gatekeeper or some sort of aloof information broker, providing information to users while keeping the mystery of the searching and finding to myself.
Connecting users to information does not necessarily mean making that connection personally, but often means providing users with the ability to find the information for themselves.
The should be no room for personal ego or aggrandizement in a public service.
I have learned a large number of skills, strategies, and tools for finding different kinds of information, and sometimes the greatest service I can provide will be to pass those skills on rather than only passing along the information I have found with them.
Just as I would never hoard the information to which I have access away from my users, I will also never hoard the means to access that information.

Many of those skills are related to the technical aspects of Information Science, the standards, practices, and formats that are used within the profession to make sense of the nearly infinite amount of information that is available.
It sometimes seems like there is nothing librarians like better than creating new and "better" ways to catalog, classify, organize, categorize, and store the information and resources to which we have access.
It is important, then, to remember the reason for all this, which is to make it possible to know, and thus find, the right information for our users.
Information cannot be used if we do not know it is there, and it will not be used if we do not know it is relevant.
These technical aspects allow the information we have to be used, and using standard systems allow libraries and information organizations to share resources, so that even more information is available to more users.
I will need to always keep on top of the technical side of the profession in order to make sure the best and most relevant information is available and usable by the greatest number of users.

Unfortunately, while it is vital to keep consistent and up to date on technical standards, I do feel it is almost impossible to truly master these standards.
More than any other part of the LIS profession, technical standards are a constantly moving target that are always changing and updating.
In part this is unavoidable as the standards strive to keep apace with the technology used in those standards, which changes even faster and more abruptly.
It is also necessary as no standard is perfect, with limitations and exceptions always being discovered---usually when they break down or fail for a real life resource or usage.
Learning the standards and applying them, then, is a part of Library and Information Service that is never complete, and can never end.
As I go forward in my career, I will always remember that I am still, in many ways, a student, and will never stop learning my trade.

More than skills alone are necessary, though, for me to fulfill the core purpose of connecting users to information.
This core purpose is supported and informed by the values I hold, which have been refined but not altered since I began my MLIS coursework.
It is my duty, I feel, to connect _all_ users to information, without prejudice or bias.
I have always believed this, in an abstract way, but in the last two years I have seen how this affects library service directly, and how the profession as a whole may not always be successful at fulfilling this duty.
Some populations are still underserved, all but invisible because of their economic situation, their ability or the perception of their ability, or even simply their age.
One of my most strongly held beliefs is that, for the rest of my life and career, I must not only work to serve all equally, but work to recognize the situations in which inequality may exists even if it is not obvious.

I also feel that my duty is not just to serve _all_ users, but also to promote access to _all_ information as much as possible.
This is a fight in which libraries have been at the forefront from the very beginning of modern information service.
For as long as libraries have served information, there have been those who wish to limit access to that information, if not destroy it completely.
It is no coincidence that one of the highest principles put forth in the ALA Code of Ethics, second only to equal service for all users, is the dedication to intellectual freedom and the fight against censorship.
One of our greatest duties is to protect the information we preserve, and to protect our users' right to that information.
It will sometimes be difficult to uphold this duty in the face of resistance, and it may at times be impossible to follow it without compromise, but I will fight for any quarter given, and will always consider such compromises to be temporary limits, not final and irrevocable outcomes.

The way I look at Library and Information Science has been refined and forged in the last two years, but my dedication to service has only grown.
I truly believe that the greatest contribution I could give to the profession is to serve my clients to the best of my ability, and to help all of my patrons find the information they need without prejudice, and without limits.
Whatever else I do, whether my actions affect the entire industry or only a single user, will be in support of this goal.
I will seek to make the right information available to users, whether that means searching for it myself or teaching how to find it.
I will never stop learning the technical and personal skills needed to connect the most relevant information to the user who need it.
And I will always strive to make _all_ needed information available to _all_ users, equally, not just in my own interactions, but also in the practices of every institution and organization in which I end up working.
To do anything less would be a betrayal of my most dearly held values, and my most important reasons for entering this career.
